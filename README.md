## Covid-19-NLP-Investigation: Drugs Sentiment Analysis 
In our investigation we will use the "COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)" <br/>
https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge dataset. 

*CORD-19 is a resource of over 63,000 scholarly articles, including over 51,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.*


### Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. As of 15 May 2020, more than 4.53 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 307,000 deaths. More than 1.63 million people have recovered.

According to the World Health Organization, there are no available vaccines nor specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19. On 1 May 2020, the United States gave Emergency Use Authorization to the antiviral **remdesivir** for people hospitalized with severe COVIDâ€‘19.

**In this project we will try to analyze and find the most relevant drugs names mentioned in CORD-19 data coprus related to the treatment of COVID-19.**
