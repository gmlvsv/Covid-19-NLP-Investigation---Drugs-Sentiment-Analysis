Nevertheless, valuable data from rhesus monkeys revealed an intravenous 10 mg/kg dose of remdesivir could lead to a remarkably high intracellular concentration (>10 mM) of active triphosphate form in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for at least 24 h, 20 supporting its clinical potential in the treatment of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In-vitro studies have shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can both inhibit SARS-CoV-2 transmission, 3-5 through alkalinisation of the intracellular phagolysosome, which prevents virion fusion and uncoating and, therefore, viral spread.
Following another portable CXR, infectious service consult, and suspicion of COVID-19, oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, meropenem, and vancomycin were started (azithromycin and ceftazidime were discontinued in our center).
To determine more carefully the efficacy of Teriflunomide, which can be transferred to clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2 immediately as an approved drug, a bit low MOI of 0.03 (Fig.
2000) and even after a high daily dose (600 μg/kg) where Cmax of 105-119 ng/ml (0.12-0.14 μM) has been obtained by PK/PD modeling (Smit et al., 2019) .As we previously showed (Pimenta et al., 2010 ) that ivermectin is a nonselective inhibitor of three important mammalian P-type ATPases (SERCA, Na + /K + -ATPase and H + /K + -ATPase) at similar micromolar concentrations (IC 50 ≈ 6-17 μM), we have to be concerned with putative important adverse effects that this drug could produce at the higher than usual doses that would be necessary for treating COVID-19 patients.
37 It was reported that synergistic effect of selenium with ginseng stem‐leaf saponins could induce immune response to a live bivalent infectious bronchitis coronavirus vaccine in chickens.

They argued that coronaviruses bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, and ibuprofen administration can increase the bioavailability of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, therefore potentiating and enhancing the infectious processes of coronaviruses.
All four trials are being carried out in China, three are investigating antiviral medications (lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol (umifenovir), darunavir, cobicstat, and, ASC09/ritonavir) and one trial is investigating a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir with Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM).
13 In another study that is yet to be peer-reviewed, clinical improvement was observed in 25/31 (80.6%) of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine as compared to 17/31 (54.8%) in the control group that received standard treatment (including antivirals other than hydroxychloroquine).
Hence, based on the epidemiologic, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and radiologic findings, a diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection was made according to the criteria published by WHO.6During the hospitalization, in addition to symptomatic treatment, the patient was treated with antibiotics (meropenem, linezolid) and antiviral agents (ganciclovir, oseltamivir).
Five neutral drugs, namely, carfilzomib, eravacycline,valrubicin, lopinavir, and elbasvir, are identified to have inhibitoryactivities against SARS-CoV-2 main protease.

Based on this result it was hypothesized that amantadine could serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus, likely leading to better clinical outcomes (Smieszek et al., 2020) .
The high level of sequence identified between two proteases allows one to assume that baicalein will bind to the SARS-CoV 3CLpro in the same way as it does to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
For the treatment of ordinary and severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and to lower the mortality rate of COVID-19 disease, the antiviral drugs remdesivir, favipiravir, umifenovir, and lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon β-1a should be administered, in particular after the consideration of (preliminary) results from the recent ongoing clinical trials SOLIDARITY and DisCoVeRy [141, 91] Authors´ contributionsCN and DLM conceived the original idea and wrote large parts of the manuscript.
Whilst recommended products as 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite may be effective to disinfect fomites within 1 minute, they cannot be used for air sanitation due to their intrinsic toxicity, especially for short term airborne prophylaxis [43] .In view of the above, considering the importance of asymptomatic individuals in the communicability of the infection, it seems interesting and worth testing OSCN-in vitro against SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, in a group of 340 ICU patients with ARDS, the CFR at 90 days was 32% in a group given a neuromuscular blocker and 41% in the placebo group [14] .We then applied the 34.1% value from the meta-analysis to the data in Table 1 , giving an estimated CFR of 1.37% ([14 x 34.1%]/349) for COVID-19.

Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration approved a National Institutes of Health adaptive randomised controlled clinical trial of investigational therapeutics (the first investigational drug being remdesivir) for patients hospitalised with COVID-19.4Recently, the American College of Rheumatology suggested that patients should ‘talk to their rheumatologist or rheumatology professional prior to discontinuing any medications… providers should follow their current practice for interrupting therapy during episodes of infection’.15 However, there are currently no official guidelines on holding immunosuppression in patients with autoimmune diseases at risk for contracting COVID-19.
For example, in Iran, there is a serious shortage of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can be recommended instead.
Data concerning co-morbidities is limited because the majority of patients with non-complicated acute appendicitis were young and did not have associated severe disease, but common sense must prevail before proposing non-surgical treatment to patients with at-risk antecedent history (immunosuppression, patients with mechanical heart valves …).Obviously, the efficacy of non-surgical treatment in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has never been assessed.

1 Several agents or drugs including, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir (used in combination) and chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been highlighted based on the promising in-vitro results and therapeutic experiences from another two coronavirus diseases including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 2 .
The predicted heparin binding basic amino acid contain sequences are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
These findings suggest that if remdesivir proves to be efficacious in COVID-19 patients, and is deployed widely as a treatment, the majority of SARS-CoV-2 strains currently circulating should be susceptible to this drug.
A recent case series of 53 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received remdesivir under a compassionate-use protocol reported clinical improvement in 68% after a median follow-up of 18 days, with 13% mortality and a generally acceptable toxicity profile [54].
Remdesivir is a drug currently under the development for Ebola virus infection and is effective to a broad range of viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 67,68.
The structural change of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD observed in the presence of heparin by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.
In previous betacoronavirus epidemics, several antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir-ritonavir, and darunavir/cobicistat (prezcobix) were tested, with some showing promising in vitro results [53].
Specifically, hydroxychloroquine use with or without co-administration of azithromycin did not improve mortality or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients.
A cathepsin B/L-dependent auxiliary activation pathway is operative in many TMPRSS2 À cell lines but seems not to be available in viral target cells in the lung because TMPRSS2dependent activation of the S protein is essential for robust MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spread and pathogenesis in the infected host (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019; Simmons et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2015) .The S1/S2 site in SARS-CoV-2 forms an exposed loop ( Figure 1B ) that harbors multiple arginine residues (multibasic) (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) that are not found in SARS-CoV-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) but are present in the human coronaviruses OC43, HKU1, and MERS-CoV ( Figure 1C ).
In a recent clinical study in China, it was demonstrated that CQ treatment of COVID-19 patients had a clinical benefit versus control treatment [6] .Results of an open label non-randomized clinical trial with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in France support these findings [7] .
Despite the controversy surrounding its use independent of the COVID-19 pandemic, [46, 47] neoadjuvant chemotherapy  cetuximab or neoadjuvant chemotherapy  immunotherapy may be considered, in certain settings, at this time.
HIV antiviralsIn-vitro antiviral activity of darunavir against SARS-CoV-2 showed no activity at clinically relevant concentrations.
It is noteworthy that even pharmaceutical-grade heparin preparations remain a polydisperse mixture of natural products, containing both anticoagulant and nonanticoagulant saccharide structures.
To test this hypothesis, known currently available IVIG products, Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF, were tested for cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Here we determined two cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex either in the apo form or in a complex with a template-primer RNA and the antiviral drug Remdesivir.
There was no difference in the 28-day mortality rate between heparin users and non-users (30.3% vs 29.7%, P = 0.910).
A small non-randomized study showed that combination azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was associated with more effective SARS-CoV2 clearance in COVID-19 patients compared with either monotherapy with hydroxychloroquine or standard of care; however, numerous limitations of this study render the data uninterpretable (140) .
It should be noted, however, that activation of ITAM occurs through phosphorylation by certain members of Src family of tyrosine kinases such as Fyn and Syk.
The rate of hospital admissions are very high and the mortality is elevated; age and the development of pneumonia are risk factors for mortality, while the use of hydroxychloroquine could have had a protective effect, at least in dialysis patients .In Spain, SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread throughout all the Autonomous Communities.
All consecutive hospitalized patients (March 16 th -30 th ) with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, older than 18 years, were treated for 2 weeks with baricitinib tablets 4 mg/day added to ritonavirlopinavir therapy.
Molecular dynamics, Docking and Structure refinementTo this end, we performed molecular dynamics and structure-guided drug binding analysis to screen the Arbidol binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein though two independent servers: (i) HADDOCK2.2 (https://haddock.science.uu.nl/), and (ii) SwissDock (http://swissdock.ch/docking) for reliability using SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein trimer (PDB: 6VSB) [2] .
5–8Therefore, it was reasonable that, among others, colchicine would be tested in the context of COVID-19.
1a) SARS-CoV-2 infectionWe next analyzed the relationship between the antiviral effect and treatment timing of protoporphyrin IX and verteporfin.
Based on this mechanism of action, Gurwitz recently suggests ARBs (losartan and telmisartan) as a tentative therapy for COVID-19 patients prior to the development of ALI/acute respiratory failure.
Studies are required to validate this hypothesis and to evaluate the therapeutic and prophylactic potential of drugs that temporarily target androgen activity, such as androgen receptor inhibitors, steroidogenesis inhibitors and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors 20 .The elucidation of the role of testosterone in the battle towards COVID-19 infection turns out to be an urgent need.
In addition, studies have shown that the serine protease TMPRSS2 can prime S protein 15, 18 although other proteases like cathepsin B/L can also be involved 18 .
For example, a docking study of lopinavir along with other HIV proteinase inhibitors of the CoV proteinase (PDBID 1UK3) suggests atazanavir and ritonavir, which are listed in the present prediction results, may inhibit the CoV proteinase in line with the inhibitory potency of lopinavir (14) .
ACE2 is normally expressed in cardiovascular, lung type II alveolar epithelial cells and kidneys with tissue-specific activity patterns [1, 2] and also in the placenta [3] .The serine protease for virus Spike (S) protein priming, TMPRSS2, was also reported to be necessary for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry [4] .
However, we recommend using an alternative to dexamethasone in a PUI or patient with known COVID-19 infection given the risk of worsening clinical severity.
We compared the level of inflammatory factors and hematological parameters between two different groups of disease severity (Table 3) , and six candidate indexes (CRP, PCT, lymphocyte, NLR, fibrinogen, and D-dimer) were chosen for ROC test.
These cytokines promote release of ultralarge VWF multimers, production of TF and FVII/FVIIa leading to increased thrombin generation, and decrease levels of endogenous anticoagulants such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), antithrombin, and activated protein C [43].
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are able to inhibit replication at early stages of viral infection, increasing endosomal pH at the time of virus/cell fusion, as well as impairing the glycosylation of cellular receptors of many viruses including coronavirus [3].
Les Conclusion généraleLa crise de Covid-19 est inédite à de nombreux égards, et pourrait exacerber certaines dimensions du processus suicidaire à travers son impact psychique, social, économique ou encore biologique.
Ribavirin With or Without Interferon ::: PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS IN WHICH RISKS OUTWEIGH BENEFITSRibavirin, a guanosine analog that terminates RNA synthesis, was first approved in the 1980s and has been used clinically for respiratory syncytial virus, viral hemorrhagic fever, and in combination with interferon for hepatitis C. As mentioned previously (see LPV/r section), it was evaluated against SARS-CoV-1 in 2003 and used clinically in combination with corticosteroids and/or interferon in the absence of other treatment options; however, outcomes were either poor or ill-defined [54, 55].
Another type of antiviral medication used for SARS-CoV-2 patients is ganciclovir [13], normally used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with compromised immune system and at risks of inhibiting virus replication [70].
Vitamins A, B, thymosin alpha-1, thymopentin can be promising options for the adjunctive treatment of coronavirus and the prevention of lung infection [17].
Monitoring and evaluation of medication safetyIn addition to current antiviral drugs recommended by the latest Chinese guidance, 7 tocilizumab is recommended for severe patients with extensive lung disease and elevated IL-6 levels.
Thus, amodiaquine could be explored in the near-term as a potential acute therapeutic treatment agent against COVID19 in nations where this drug is more readily available, and it may be particularly valuable in Africa and other low resource nations where supplies of more expensive alternative therapies are limited.
40 In Tocilizumab Tocilizumab has been utilized as adjunct therapy in COVID-19 patients displaying signs of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
In our opinion, this could be a reasonable off-label use of tocilizumab in these early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, although patients and physicians should be fully aware that currently there is only a non-peer-reviewed, non-comparative, observational experience (very low evidence from an unreviewed cases series) and that it only supports a potential favorable effect on inflammatory signs and symptoms, while there is no information on any possible effect on survival.
Several large cohorts have already agreed to join these efforts, including the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), NHSII, NHS3, the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS), TwinsUK, American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study 3 (CPS-3), the Multiethnic Cohort Study, the California Teachers Study (CTS), the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), the Sister Study, Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE), the Stanford Nutrition Studies, the Gulf Long-term Follow-up (GuLF) Study, the Agricultural Health Study, the NIEHS Environmental Polymorphisms Registry, and the Predicting Progression of Developing Myeloma in a High-Risk Screened Population (PROMISE) and Precursor Crowdsourcing (PCROWD) Studies.
It is noted that lopinavir wasobserved to be effective in treating COVID-19 patients.
Some promising results have shown that the EC90 value of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells is 1.76μM, suggesting its working concentration is likely to be achieved in nonhuman primate models, and remdesivir was found to inhibit virus infection efficiently in a human cell line (human liver cancer Huh-7 cells), which is sensitive to 2019-nCoV [78].
The COVID-19 patients are per se scared of the disease, and moreover, long-term high-dose use of sedative and analgesic medicine readily leads to delirium and restlessness once discontinuation; therefore, psychotropic drugs (e.g., alprazolam, flupentixol and melitracen tablets) should also be administrated besides bolstering psychological comfort.
There is a strong rationality for the use of chloroquine to treat infections with intracellular micro-organisms.
Travel patternsAlthough travel restrictions can be effective in the intervention of infectious disease spread, they are temporary and difficult to sustain in the long term [21] .
Indeed, camostat mesylate significantly reduced MERS-S-, SARS-S-, and SARS-2-S-but not VSV-G-driven entry into the lung cell line Calu-3 ( Figure 4C ) and exerted no unwanted cytotoxic effects (Figure S3 C).

We also examine the potential of repurposing HIV protease inhibitors, Aluvia and Norvir, for 2019-nCoV.properties.
Recently, works from several groups demonstrated, either bioinformatically or experimentally, that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV virus [12] , is also a functional cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus [6, 7, [13] [14] [15] , and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Furin are two proteases that process SARS-CoV-2 S protein to establish efficient infection [13, 14, 16, 17] .Single-cell RNA (scRNA) profiling is a state-of-the-art tool to dissect gene expression at single cell level, therefore was employed to explore the target cells of the SARS-CoV-2.
Such drugs will be amenable to routine parenteral administration through currently established routes and additionally, direct to the respiratory tract via nasal administration, using nebulised heparin, which would be unlikely to gain significant access to the circulation.
Although concerns have been raised regarding the use of GKRS, a systematic review published in this year provides support for use of radiosurgery when encountering the challenging situation of multiple patient comorbidities and the inability to proceed with chemotherapy due to systemic instability or the inability to receive in-patient medical treatment due to COVID-19 outbreak [9] .Standard treatment (ST) for PCNSL consists of different methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimens associated with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) [2] [3] [4] .Unfortunately, ST requires high-dosage regimens that can result in methotrexate toxicity and a broad range of serious side-effects, especially in elderly or immunocompromised patients [1] .

Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for the treatment of Ebola virus infections [90] , is a promising compound [91] , since preclinical studies have suggested that remdesivir may be effective for both prophylaxis and treatment of HCoV infections [54, 92, 93] .
On behalf of the scientists and surgeons of one of the biggest orthopedic institutes in Italy, located in Milan, we feel the urge to share our position about the recent warnings on the use of anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in this coronavirus “era.” Similarly to the antihypertensive drugs angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta blockers, and the oral antidiabetic drugs thiazolidinediones, some author have suggested that NSAIDs, particularly Ibuprofen, may induce increased sensitivity to more severe clinical features in coronavirus (Covid-19) infection.
Of note, real-time reverse transcription PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs remained positive at 4 days after the administration of remdesivir, but the authors noted a trend in the decline of viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs [cycle threshold values: illness Day 7 (the day of remdesivir administration), 23-24; Day 11, 33-34; and Day 12, 37-40].

In a recent in vitro study, remdesivir was also shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 [46].
In fact, one can argue that the alleged tocilizumab efficacy both for treating COVID-19 and irAEs might suggest a potentially increased danger from SARS-CoV-2 infection for ICI-treated patients, maybe hypothesizing a synergy in the promotion of the viral morbidity.
The most possible adverse events were abnormal liver function tests, psychiatric symptom reactions, digestive tract reactions and raised serum uric acid [3 (2.50 %) in arbidol group vs. 16 (13.79%) in favipiravir group, P < 0.0001].

Hydroxychloroquine, the HIV protease inhibitors (particularly lopinavir), ribavirin, and remdesivir are the most promising drugs proposed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment, but currently no drug has been proposed for postexposure or preexposure prophylaxis for those accidently exposed to SARS-CoV-2 [6].
Some researchers had also suggested as early as January 2020 what treatment options might be most likely and these included lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favilavir, arbidol, as well as a broad array of nucleoside analogs, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptides, RNA synthesis inhibitors, anti-inflammatory drugs and traditional Chinese medicines [15] [16] [17] .The need for other treatment options will be important as we learn more about its transmission [18] and as we see increases in the number of travel-related infections [19] .
Because it depends on the patient's liver and kidney function, whether there is complications and adverse reactions, there are various combinations, the most common combinations are the following: interferon (IFN) + LPV/r, IFN + arbidol, oseltamivir + arbiodol, IFN + LPV/r + arbidol.
However, given the cost, immunosuppression, and potential adverse reactions of tocilizumab, this strategy will likely be restricted to select patients in developed countries.

A Platinum Opinion editorial on cancer treatment guidelines during the COVID-19 scenario has been published in European Urology in which Gillessen Sommer and Powles provide an overview of suggestions regarding systemic treatment in different urologic cancers [2] .While I totally agree on the management for renal, germcell, and urothelial cancers, personally I do not agree with two conclusions regarding prostate cancer therapy, namely that treatment with oral androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) should not be stopped and that chemotherapy should be replaced with an oral ARSI during the COVID-19 pandemic [2] .Although it is true that chemotherapy and radiotherapy lead to suppression of the immune system, thus exposing patients, especially those >70 yr of age, to a greater infectious risk, and most chemotherapies induce neutropenia, affecting neutrophils, the body's first line of defense, I believe that a warning regarding ARSIs is also necessary for the three following reasons.
In this regard, the drug tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker) has been approved in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated IL-6 in China (16) .
In vitro testing has also shown that remdesivir has activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 value of 1.76 μM in Vero E6 cells suggesting its working concentration is likely to be achieved in nonhuman primate models [8].
However, recently published treatment recommendations advise to withhold these agents during COVID-19 illness due to the increased risk of dehydration and development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (42) .Anyhow, a prospective phase III clinical study is ongoing to assess the potential effect of dapagliflozin in reducing the risk of serious complications and organ failure in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04350593).

Looking back on the medications used to fight SARS-CoV, initially ribavirin was recognized as a widely active antiviral drug that was effective against a range of RNA viruses but was of little use to SARS patients.
The mechanistic study of chlorpromazine (8) on MERS-CoV indicated that it inhibited the virus at both an early and postentry stage, suggesting that an effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis was not only the sole antiviral mechanism.
Investigators concluded that there is no evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical benefit of the combination of HCQ and azithromycin for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.
This study is the first randomised trial of intravenous remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19, so it is difficult to know what the minimally clinically important difference is.

Once FDP ≥ 10 g/mL and/or DD ≥ 5 μg/mL, unfractionated heparin (3–15 IU/kg per hour) should be used.
Aldosterone in turn increases ACE activity inducing further production of Ang II, leading to a potentially vicious cycle which perpetuates ARDS.
These patients were recruited and screened, and eligible patients were enrolled and treated with danoprevir boosted by ritonavir in the presence or absence of interferon nebulization (as the background therapy) for 4 to12 days until being discharged from the hospital.
1 After thoroughly summarizing the literature studies on the efficacy and safety of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), they rightly concluded that there is currently no robust evidence to support prescribing HCQ as a treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19.
Arbidol Hydrochloride (Umifenovir) ::: 7.3.
[31] [32] [33] [34] It is therefore of utmost importance that we understand the safety implications of the proposed combination of HCQ and azithromycin AZM before this becomes standard practice in the management of COVID-19 globally.

A recent open-label non-randomized clinical trial of HCQ and azithromycin as treatment for COVID-19 excluded pregnant and breastfeeding patients from the study [1] .
Although remdesivir is described as a substrate for CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in-vitro, it is thought that inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are unlikely to cause significant drug interactions since remdesivir's metabolism is likely mediated by hydrolase activity.
In addition to antimicrobial peptides, IL-22 upregulates mucins, fibrinogen, anti-apoptotic proteins, serum amyloid A, and LPS binding protein 3 ; therefore, IL-22 may contribute to the formation of life-threatening edema enriched with mucins and fibrin, seen in SARS-CoV-2 2 and SARS-CoV patients.
As for the rest 6 human proteins without available crystal structures, 4 of them were modelled by SWISS-MODEL, and 2 were modelled by Robetta because of the poor sequence similarity (<30%), which are transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and caveolin-2.

In animal models, the loss of ACE2 resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NADPH oxidase 2 activation, and administration of recombinant ACE2 was shown to inhibit the angiotensin II effects on TGF-β1 activation and collagen production [14] .
Another method was to use the nucleotide analog inhibitors, such as the remdesivir, which targets the viral polymerase (RNA dependant RNA polymerase).This approach diminished the ability of the virus to copy its genome; thus, the replication cycle J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f may be interrupted.
MethodsData have been collected from February 16 th to March 30 th , 2020 on the particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and ozone (O 3 ) for the city of Barcelona, provided by the Xarxa de Vigilància i Previsió de Atmospheric Pollution (XVPCA), of the Generalitat de Catalunya (XVPCA, 2020) .
15, 16 In contrast to Sofosbuvir (Fig.
If R 0 could be reduced below unity, an epidemic would fade away and could be got rid of, but except in a small isolated community some virus would always remain, and when social distancing was relaxed, the epidemic would begin anew.
Interestingly, glucocorticoids provide a renoprotective effect in AKI via glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper- (GILZ-) induced immunosuppression [66].
Furthermore, small experiences of using azithromycin in COVID-19 patients have provided conflicting results (see previous section).

Methadone and buprenorphine are on the WHO list of essential medications [14].
A non-randomized clinical trial reported the reduction of the viral load from the hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination in twenty COVID-19 patients but failed to report the critical clinical outcomes, including death [115] .Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are the immunomodulatory drugs with potential antiviral effects.
As spills are inevitable, surfaces should be cleaned rapidly by using appropriate absorbent and by decontamination with chlorine (5000-10 000 mg/l) or another appropriate disinfectant (note that chlorhexidine is ineffective against COVID-19 and is not appropriate) [12] .
Searching for baicalein analogues that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL proWe searched for baicalein analogues from available flavonoid suppliers and selected 8 flavonoids and 2 glycosides for experimental testing.
19 The other trial, a 30-patient, placebo-controlled study of HCQ in patients with relatively mild COVID-19 infections, using 400 mg of HCQ daily, did not show any differences between drug and placebo groups in viral clearance, duration of hospitalisation or radiological progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.
We identified no published clinical trials of the effect of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.
For RdRp, from generated docking model, remdesivir could bind to the RNA-binding channel of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and the binding mode and site were highly similar to that of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) RdRp inhibitor GPC-N114 49 .The binding pocket of remdesivir was in the bottom of the RNA template channel, which position was for the acceptor template nucleotide (Fig.

Unfortunately, restrictive criteria for the use of tocilizumab and referral to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) during this COVID-19 pandemia, is the daily practice in most hospitals worldwide, due to the shortage of breath assisted equipment and access to tocilizumab treatment.
Customers perceive CEO (and other top managers') participation as sign of respect and commitment to the buyerseller relationship, and react by trusting the partner as a source of resources to combat the crisis and what comes after it.
In addition, we also noticed abnormal ALT and creatinine levels in most patients who died, but most of the abnormalities were mild, suggesting that COVID-19 patients may die primarily from respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, rather than multiple organ failure.
To inform optimal dosing of hydroxychloroquine, the investigators then performed PBPK modeling.
In this review, we found 24 clinical trials that have already started with the repositioning of more than 20 medicines for COVID-19 treatment, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, oseltamivir, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and TCM.
An observational study of 21 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with Tocilizumab showed promising results 23, 24 .
In this context, incorporating a better description of sojourn times is extremely important.
At that time, hydroxychloroquine was started.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 and the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for entry into host cells [6] .
This cell entry seems to be crucial for the virus to infect the cell and uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [12] as well as the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), that are both expressed on human cells.
332 333 Nitazoxanide mechanism of action for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown.
While the precise mechanism by which chloroquine and its more active derivative hydroxychloroquine inhibit virus replication is not known, reports suggest that the compounds may act by reducing the glycosylation of ACE2 [31] .
Tocilizumab ::: Adjunctive interventionsOne of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of COVID-19 is cytokine storm characterized by elevated levels of IL6, IFN- and other cytokines, which will lead to ARDS or even multiple organ failure [70].

L'enjeu de cette revue est de proposer cinq axes de collecte d'information et de réflexion :• décrire l'enjeu de la continuité d'accès aux psychotropes en situation pandémique et de confinement ;• dresser un descriptif général sur le rapport bénéfice/risque des adaptations thérapeutiques éventuelles sur les psychotropes dans ce contexte ; • apporter des informations sur l'impact des psychotropes au regard des symptômes de la COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019 ou maladie à coronavirus 2019) ; • décrire succinctement les liens entre substances psychoactives et COVID-19 ; • proposer une synthèse des interactions entre les psychotropes et les traitements susceptibles d'être proposés au décours de la COVID-19.Ces informations doivent être considérées avec prudence compte tenue de la connaissance encore imparfaite de cette infection virale.
In our search for these antivirals, we first focused on Remdesivir, which has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 after viral entry .
The widely used diagnostic criteria of HIT include: 1) HIT antibodies to complexes of heparinoid (heparin or similar glycosaminoglycans) and PF4; 2) HIT antibodies-mediated platelet activation; 3) a progressive PLT decrease of at least 40-50% or more from baseline; 4) onset of thrombocytopenia occuring within five to ten days after initiation of heparin or 24 to 48 hours after heparin re-exposure; and 5) thrombosis in patients treated with heparin.
Understanding the concentration-dependent toxicity of chloroquine is essential in determining the risk-benefit trade-off in COVID-19 clinical trials.
The viral pneumonia patients were treated with arbidol, approved in Russia and China for influenza treatment.
Cet effet de la chlorpromazine pourrait correspondre à un effet de classe puisque plusieurs phénothiazines ont montré une efficacité sur les MERS-CoV et SARS-CoV [3] .
However, the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be established.
We then proceeded to evaluate the effects of nafamostat mesylate on actual SARS-CoV-2 infection in both types of cells with or without pretreatment .
Yet unconfirmed reports indicated that inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication including chloroquine are clinical efficient against declared SARS-CoV-2 infection [62–64].
Rationale: IVIG might help to improve the outcome of patients with COVID-19The study (23) included ten patients with COVID-19 who demonstrated worsening symptoms, e.g., decreased lymphocyte count and decreased PaO2/FIO2 ratio and oxygen saturation, following treatment with a short-term moderate-dose corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 80 mg/d) plus immunoglobulin (10 g/d).
Of those patients in whom COVID-19 is diagnosed during ovarian stimulation, which future palliative treatments (e.g., hydroxychloroquine) could safely be applied rather than cancelling the cycle?
On the other 40 hand, transversion most likely occurs at a low rate, but the guanine (G) to thymine (T) transversion in particular has been observed in both DP isolates and other SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Fig.
Remdesivir, created by Gilead Sciences (development code GS-5734), is an RdRP inhibitor that was developed to treat Ebola and Marburg virus infections and has been reported to have antiviral activity against MERS and SARS 36-38 .
Given its questionable efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 and its risk of QT-prolongation, chloroquine treatment must be considered thoroughly, and reviewed on a regular basis.
This is easily explained on the basis of the crystal structures: In the enterovirus 3C pro s, the fluorine can accept a hydrogen bond from Arg39 (ref.
Similarly, the mean level of lactate dehydrogenase level detected in the blood of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (315.75U/L) was elevated relative to the recommended reference range for children aged 1 to 10 years (<305U/L) 48 .
As recently reported by Hoffman et al 11, the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 can be blocked by an inhibitor of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which is employed by SARS-CoV-2 for S protein priming.

Thus, the typical lymphopenia during SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-γ levels and aggravated inflammatory responses, leading not only to pulmonary injury, but also the injury of non-pulmonary organs including the liver [28].
As shown in Figure S5 , other drugs that target this subnetwork include Masitinib, Erlotinib, and Sorafenib, which could be further examined in downstream analyses.
Currently, baricitinib (NCT04320277, NCT04340232, NCT04321993), tofacitinib (NCT04332042) and ruxolitinib (NCT04331665) studies are ongoing.
DiscussionThe simulations that we provide confirm current hypotheses that the virologic response to hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients has a pharmacokinetic basis, and that the drug dosages with an acceptable toxicity profile have a narrow window of overlap with the antiviral effective concentrations.
Antimalarial prophylactic drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, are believed to act on the entry and post-entry stages of SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus) and SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection, likely via effects on endosomal pH and the resulting under-glycosylation of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptors that are required for viral entry.
Given the poorly understood relationship between COVID-19 and hypertension [28] , it is important to note that non-receptor-subtype selective ( ⍺ 1A = ⍺ 1B = ⍺ 1D ) ⍺ 1 -ARs, such as prazosin, are used to reduce blood pressure, whereas receptor-subtype selective drugs such as tamsulosin ( ⍺ 1A = ⍺ 1D > ⍺ 1B ) have fewer hemodynamic effects.
ACE2 may be differentially upregulated by ACEi, ARB, and aldosterone antagonists [12, 13, 14].
However, he failed to improve with standard treatment for ICI-pneumonitis (high dose steroids, infliximab) and was found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection by a nasal swab RT-PCR assay.
Secondary structural prediction was calculated using the BeStSel analysis server {Micsonai, 2015 #9}.To ensure that the CD spectral change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence of porcine mucosal heparin did not arise from the addition of the heparin alone, which is known to possess a CD spectrum at high concentrations 17,18 a difference spectrum was analysed.

Furthermore, assumptions were made on how the hospital administration, the cantonal authorities, and the federal government would react to a worsening outbreak to prepare our department for the potential impact of these external factors on patient care.
These tandem groups regularly switch on- and off-site assignments every fortnight to overcome the 14-day half-life of the SARS-CoV-2.
With the recovery of the disease and the transformation of the viral nucleic acid, the blood phosphorus level and the absolute value of lymphocytes in the majority of severe/critical patients returned to normal.
Upon binding to ACE-2, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 activate the transmembrane serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2), which is highly expressed in the lungs.
For VEEV and influenza, NHC/EIDD-2801 exerts its antiviral activity on the RdRp, leading to error catastrophe by inducing an error rate of replication that surpasses the error threshold allowed to sustain a virus population (14, 15).
An interim guidance on COVID-19 coagulopathy released on Mar 25 by experts of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) suggests a conventional prophylactic dose of enoxaparin 4000 U (or equivalent dose of another low molecular weight heparin) once daily [4] .However, the same prophylactic dose is insufficient to prevent venous thromboembolism in non-COVID-19 ICU patients, who develop pulmonary embolism 10% of cases [5] .
Transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2TMPRSS2 is a serine protease highly expressed within the lung and gastrointestinal tissues, including stomach, small and large bowel, pancreas and liver.

She was treated empirically with intravenous ceftriaxone given her leukopenia A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 6 and elevated risk for urinary tract infection, but this was stopped after the urine and blood cultures, which were obtained prior to antibiotics, showed no growth at 24 hours.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
It is important to note that use of oseltamivir was not as targeted therapy of SARS-CoV-2 but rather driven by the lack of a knowledge of the causative pathogen at the time of treatment and the desire to empirically treat influenza.
In considering existing evidences with respect to coronavirus, we performed Spearman's rank correlation analysis (data not normally distributed) using SPSS22.0 (IBM Corporation) and results as shown in Fig 1 revealed that there was a statistically significant negative association between ambient average ozone levels (48.83-94.67 µg/m 3 ) during Jan-March，2020 and confirmed COVID-19 cases (log scale) for Chinese major cities(Supporting Information File S1 and Fig S1) (p-value=0.039).
Simple prevention measures can help slow the spread of the epidemic : (i) wash hands regularly with a hydroalcoholic solution or with water and soap; (ii) stay more than a meter away from anyone who is coughing or sneezing; (iii) cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and immediately dispels the handkerchief into a closed bin; (iv) avoid gatherings as they increase the risk of transmission of respiratory viruses indeed, this has been demonstrated in Senegal during the Grand Magal of Touba [4] .For the treatment of Coronavirus disease-19, the use of old drugs like hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is a very interesting strategy because because knowledge on safety profile, side effects, posology and drug interactions are well known [5] .
Other antiviral agents that inhibit the protease activity of coronavirus and HIV in vitro or animal model studies are Lopinavir (LPV) and Ribavirin (a guanosine analogue) [18].

Oseltamivir is also used in a clinical trial with multiple combinations with chloroquine and favipiravir (31), a nucleoside analog that is well-known as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug; it has shown (23) an EC50 of 61.88 μM against SARS-CoV-2 and low toxicity (CC50 >400 μM).The lopinavir-ritonavir combination is approved for AIDS treatment in several countries.
In the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, Hydroxychloroquine is alleged to be a potential cure and has attracted many ordinary people's attention around the globe.
Oseltamivir, a neurominidase inhibitor, is currently being used by medical staff in China for suspected infections despite the lack of any conclusive evidence regarding its effectiveness on COVID-19.
The available monoclonal antibody therapies (anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, ustekinumab, or vedolizumab) should have their dosing delayed for 2 weeks while monitoring for development of COVID-19.

Although no difference on overall 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and non-users (30.3% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.91) in a report among 449 patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in China (14) , the 28-day mortality was significantly reduced in those receiving low molecular weight heparin with a D-dimer > 6 fold the upper limit of normal (32% vs. 52%, p = 0.01) or a SIC score (15) > 4 (40% vs. 64%, p = 0.02).
In-vitro studies had shown that remdesivir effectively inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [56, 57], and appeared to have effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication as well in non-human cells [42].
Other researchers have found an anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulating effect mediated by TNF-and IL-6 that would block the cascade of events leading to acute respiratory distress syndro me [10] .Notwithstanding, despite its in vitro activity against several agents, to this date there is no acute viral infection that has been successfully treated by chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.
Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 does not use other coronavirus receptors viz; alanine aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which are used by CoV-229E and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively, for entry into host cells (Li, 2015; Letko, Marzi and Munster, 2020) .ACE2 is necessary for entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, and studies have shown that the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is processed by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (Matsuyama et al.
There have been some anecdotal reports of successful chloroquine treatment from China, and the guidelines of the Italian Society for Infectious and Tropical Diseases (SIMIT) suggest its use in the case of mild forms of COVID-19, but there is a question as to whether chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can play a prophylactic role as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of chloroquine found that it did not prevent influenza infection [5] .
Concentrations of 0.1–0.5% sodium hypochlorite and 2% glutardialdehyde were also quite effective with > 3.0 log10 reduction in viral titre.
Thus, the binding pattern of five most effective compounds along with Remdesivir and Favipiravir, were analyzed to observe the common drug surface hotspot.
COVID-19 affected people patients serum show SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid viral load (RNAaemia)(49) and exhibits the symptoms which include fever, coughing, sneezing, throat pain, anorexia, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting dyspnea, the other characteristics most commonly exhibited are prolonged prothrombin time and lymphopenia.

Although this study is an open-label study using small sample size, the combination of HCQ and azithromycin could be promising candidate for COVID-19 patients.
Whatever the progress of the clinical trials is, we are expecting that the clinical trials of remdesivir, a starring drug, would bring outstanding breakthroughs to the treatment of COVID-19, or more promisingly, other virus infection in the future.
Taken 310 collectively, these data are encouraging for the application of nitazoxanide in COVID-19, assuming 311 that tizoxanide displays anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity comparable to that reported for nitazoxanide.
He was monitoring his symptoms, however, when his shortness of breath was not improving with his asthma medications (albuterol inhaler and cetirizine), he presented to the emergency department.
According to the expert consensus statement, the following basic principles should be followed when using corticosteroids: (1) the benefits and harms should be carefully weighed before using corticosteroids; (2) corticosteroids should be used prudently in critically ill patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia; (3) for patients with hypoxaemia due to underlying diseases or who regularly use corticosteroids for chronic diseases, further use of corticosteroids should be cautious; and (4) the dosage should be low-to-moderate (≤0·5–1 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent) and the duration should be short (≤7 days).Corticosteroid treatment is a double-edged sword.
Notably, hydroxychloroquine is a drug for treating patients diagnosed with malaria [Ben-Zvi et al., 2012] .
Nitazoxanide, a commercial antiprotozoal agent with an antiviral potential against a broad range of viruses including human and animal coronaviruses, inhibited the 2019-nCoV at a low-micromolar concentration (EC50 = 2.12 μM; CC50 > 35.53 μM; SI > 16.76).
After all, in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, in March 2020, Israel issued a compulsory licence in relation to Kaletra, an HIV medicine that is currently being tested for effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19.
These trials comprise the tocilizumab, which targets the interleukin-6 receptor and possibly mediates the SARS-CoV II-mediated inflammation and modulates the cytokine storms, and several neutralized monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV molecular mechanism [163, 165] .
[20] [21] [22] Other treatments for cytokine storm, such as the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist Anakinra and the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors may also prove to be useful, though to date there is little or no clinical experience with these agents in treating COVID-19.
Also, clinical studies suggest the apparent efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the treatment of pneumonia following COVID-19 infection [23] .
Thirdly, so far, the supporting treatments, combined with potent antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, chloroquine, or lopinavir/ritonavir, have been conducted with definite effect on treat COVID-19 patients, while solid data from more clinical trials are needed.
Ruxolitinib probably is the fastest and more powerful agent in the switching off the cytokine storm, as already shown in aGVHD and also in the first COVID-19 cases treated with this JAK1/2 inhibitor.
The compound with the highest binding affinity was saquinavir.
Based on these data, chloroquine was more effectively targeting drugs with less side effects ( Figure 5C ).Sc-RNA seq data in lung tissue suggested that ACE2 targeting drugs (chloroquine) were superior for COVID-19 treatment than TMPRSS2 targeting drugs (camostat mesylate).Most drugs can be metabolized in the liver.
When compared with mild and common COVID-19, initial univariate analysis of epidemiological, clinical and laboratory variables identified 11 significantly changed risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19, including increased ORs of age, age ≥50 years, period between illness onset and hospital visit, sputum production, any existing medical condition, multiple lung infection, ALT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose and CRP, as well as decreased OR of the infected area (online supplementary table 1).
Avoiding toxic exposure is even more important considering the long half-life of (hydroxy)chloroquine; hence, monitoring (hydroxy)chloroquine concentrations is suggested for this purpose.
Recommendation 10: Topical citrate anticoagulation is recommended for severe COVID-19 patients with active bleeding who require CRRT ::: Anticoagulation therapySevere COVID-19 patients with active bleeding who require CRRT should be treated with local citrate anticoagulation to avoid aggravating coagulation disorders.

Notably, pregnant women were included in the Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM, ["Together Save Lives" in the Kiswahili language]) randomized controlled trial of EVD therapeutics which compared ZMapp to MAb114, REGN-EB3, or remdesivir [7] .
Her home medications of apixaban 5 mg twice daily, metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily, and flecainide 50 mg twice daily were continued, and treatment with 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine twice daily (for 1 day, followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and 500 mg of intravenous azithromycin daily for 5 days was initiated.
Lopinavir and Ritonavir are both HIV protease inhibitors that suppress the cleavage of a polyprotein into multiple functional proteins.
China’s plan of Tocilizumab treatment has shown its remarkable effectiveness and safety in clinical practice over the past 2 months, hoping it will benefit other countries fighting the pandemic and reduce the mortality of severe COVID-19 as well.
Although immune stimulants such as IL-7 or nivolumab could theoretically feed the cytokine storm, both have been given to patients with sepsis with IL-6 concentrations similar to that in patients with COVID-19, without exacerbation of inflammatory responses.
There are no data currently about the use of remifentanil PCA in obstetric patients with COVID-19 infection.
In the reported case, the patient’s clinical condition and performance status permitted continued osimertinib treatment despite the diagnosis of COVID-19.Wang and Zhang5 pointed out that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary risk for patients with cancer is limited access to required health care and inability to receive necessary medical services in a timely fashion, especially in high-risk epidemic areas like Wuhan, China, where there is a high demand on medical staff and health care facilities.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)The use of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, has been raised as a concern in people with COVID-19 26 .
To our knowledge, since the first Chinese reporting 10 , some case reports on the treatment with tocilizumab have been reported in the international literature, with only one case series of 15 patients, globally suggesting some benefits in seriously ill patients [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .
Ribavirin (Rbv) and Favipiravir 6 belong to this class of antivirals, and are active against a variety of viruses (eg., HCV, influenza virus, Ebola virus).In the case of SARS-CoV, Rbv shows some efficacy in infected cells 7 , Rbv-5'-monophosphate (Rbv-MP) is incorporated into RNA in vitro 8 , however the drug does not control coronavirus replication in patients 9, 10 .

Two ongoing clinical randomized clinical trials in China are evaluating remdesivir for moderate and sever COVID-19 infections.
Based on the poor in vitro activity, an absence of animal or human data supporting its use, and a significant toxicity profile, we recommend avoiding use of ribavirin in patients with COVID-19 at this time.
Also, ganciclovir was predicted to bind to three subunits of the replication complex of the 2019-nCoV: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Kd 11.91 nM), 3'-to-5' exonuclease (Kd 56.29 nM), and RNA helicase (Kd 108.21 nM).
One of the anti-viral drugs being tested is chloroquine, which has a promising profile against COVID-19 as “patients treated with this drug demonstrated a better drop in fever, improvement of lung CT images, and required a shorter time to recover compared to parallel groups” [24].
The purpose of this study was to explore the correlation between hypophosphatemia and the severity of COVID-19 patients by analyzing the level and changes of serum phosphorus in severe /critically ill patients of COVID-19.
This paper will focus on the supply and demand for hydroxychloroquine.
All four patients had previously been admitted to intensive care units because of severe respiratory syndrome, with high oxygen and dedicated treatment requirement (lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, azithromycin, anticoagulation, and, eventually, tocilizumab or plasma exchange).
Spike protein cleavage can be done by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) at the cell surface, or by Cathepsin L within endosomes (de Wilde et al., 2018) .
We also observed that the saRNA LNP vaccine induces a robust cellular response, which is partially enabled by the potent LNP formulation.
Vancomycin therapy was suspended while piperacillin/tazobactam was continued to guarantee coverage against bacterial infections.
Our results, together with replication inhibition by remdesivir of a wide range of coronaviruses in vitro and in vivo (7), may further indicate utility of remdesivir against the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV emerging from Wuhan, China (26).
[69] also determined that SARS-CoV with residue 479 (lysine) and SARS-CoV-2 with glutamine 394 residue recognize and bind to lysine 31 of the ACE2 receptor in humans [70] .
Among the evaluated drugs, both remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling COVID-19 in vitro.
The antimalarials hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) have demonstrated antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro and in small, poorly controlled or uncontrolled clinical studies (1) (2) (3) .
Though bronchospasm could be attributed to carboprost tromethamine (Hemabate; Pharmacia & Upjohn Co, Division of Pfizer Inc, New York, NY), the degree of respiratory decompensation and the fever in labor prompted a nasal swab for COVID-19 testing, which came back positive 4 hours later.
In this highly demanding scenario of huge unmet need and steeply increasing morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, many government bodies and expert panels have recommended the use of chloroquine and HCQ for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.
If a severe case of COVID-19 leads to a decrease in the platelet count at > 50% of the basal value and/or shows signs of arteriovenous thrombosis after an administration of heparin, the 4 T’s score or HIT antibody can be used to diagnose HIT.
However, it would be readily testable with available ACE2 inhibitors, like Captopril, on the market since the 1970s (Enalapril would not be suited for in vitro testing, as it needs to be activated in the liver to become the active ingredient).
As a derivative of CQ, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has similar therapeutic effects and fewer adverse effects.
Effects of IBD TherapiesIt is now known that similar to the 2002 SARS-CoV, the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 requires the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor to enter the cell as well as TMPRSS2, a serine protease that cleaves the viral spike to permit viral entry.
Observing such a high prevalence in COVID-infected 27 patients was somehow unexpected since the 30% prevalence of invasive aspergillosis in 28 influenza patients has been attributed to the action of oseltamivir on anti-Aspergillus 29immunity.
At least in healthcare, many European countries were able to learn from the experiences of China and Italy and to react proactively.
Despite its encouragingly high in vitro potency against SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical success in treatment of COVID-19, 4,18 uncertainties about adverse effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, rectal hemorrhage, and hepatic toxicity) and clinical efficacy of remdesivir have been reported recently.
Indeed, RNA dependent RNA polymerase has become one of the main targets of a nucleoside analog antiviral drug, the remdesivir, already used for reducing complications due to Ebola, Dengue and MERS-CoV infections (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) .
Recommended antiviral drugs by the NHCC include interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin.
The pre-clinical safety evidence in macaques 327 presented here, in vitro efficacy, and preliminary clinical report on ivermectin efficacy in patients, 328warrants further investigation of ivermectin and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in SARS-329CoV-2 infected persons.
And fourth, there is an advantage in considering nucleotide analogues that are the active triphosphate forms of FDA-approved drugs, as these drugs are known to have acceptable levels of toxicity and are more likely to be tolerated by patients with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19.Using the above selection criteria, here we examine 11 nucleotide analogues with sugar or base modifications (structures shown in Fig.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 may use proteases similar to SARS-CoV such as TMPRSS11a, Trypsin, Plasmin, Cathepsin L and Furin in the cleavage of the spike protein for the virus to enter the cell.
The half-maximal Effective Concentration (EC50) for Ribavirin against COVID-19 is 109.5 μM, while its half-maximum Inhibition Concentration (IC50) against Dengue virus is 8 μM [29,30].
Liver injury was defined as hepatocellular if the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was >30 IU/L for males and >19 IU/L for females 5 The criteria of discharge include all the following conditions: body temperatures remain normal over 3 days, significant improvement of respiratory symptoms, resolution of pulmonary imaging of inflammation, and repeated tests at least 24 hours apart confirms SARS-CoV-2 clearance.
Arbidol, a Russian-made small indole-derivative molecule, is used for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections [87, 88] .
Lopinavir and ritonavir, active materials of AbbVie's Kaletra, both were predicted to have a potential affinity to 2019-nCoV helicase (Table 3 ) and are suggested as potential MERS therapeutics (15) .
To address the role of angiotensin in lung injury, there is an ongoing clinical trial to examine whether losartan treatment affects outcomes in COVID-19 associated ARDS (NCT04312009).
Although the optimal management is not known, a possible strategy is to reduce MMF to 50% of baseline dose and target tacrolimus level at 4-6ng/dL for those with mildmoderate infection, and to more aggressively reduce or withhold MMF in the setting of more severe Covid-19 infection.
Furthermore, formula-fed calves were treated prophy-lactically with colistin sulfate from d 2 to 8 (3 mg/kg of BW, i.m.
The natural products and derivatives with anti-virus, antiinflammation and anti-tumor effects exhibited high binding affinity to RdRp, such as betulonal from C. xylocarpa, gnidicin and gniditrin from Gnidia lamprantha, 2b,30b-dihydroxy-3,4-seco-friedelolactone-27lactone from V. diffusa, 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide from Andrographis paniculata, 1,7-dihydroxy-3-methoxyxanthone from Swerti apseudochinensis, theaflavin 3,3 0 -di-O-gallate from Camellia sinensis, and andrographolide derivative (R)-((1R,5aS,6R,9aS )-1,5a-dimethyl-7-methylene-3-oxo-6-((E )-2-(2oxo-2,5-dihydrofuran-3-yl)ethenyl)decahydro-1H-benzo [c]azepin-1-Analysis of therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 yl)methyl 2-amino-3-phenylpropanoate (Table 6 and Supporting excel file RdRp_NP.xlsx).
In line with these events, blockade of IL-6 function with a monoclonal antibody against its receptor (eg, tocilizumab) is useful for the initial treatment of patients with a so-called cytokine storm,5 and preliminary evidence suggests that such a therapy can help to prevent the detrimental inflammatory response in some cases of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia (unpublished).Most cytokines secreted during a cytokine storm and in COVID-19 are also produced in high amounts during exacerbations of immune-mediated disorders, and represent major therapeutic targets.
Remdesivir acts on viral RNA transcription at the postviral entry level, while chloroquine needs to be applied at the beginning of the infection; chloroquine’s action on lysosome membranes might interfere with the viral entry–fusion events.
Oral oseltamivir has been used for the treatment of the cases with SARS-CoV-2 7, while its efficacy currently remains uncertain.
Baricitinib could interrupt the passage of SARS-CoV-2 entering cells through inhibition of AAK1-mediated endocytosis.
We therefore recommend that COVID-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the world.
Des données récentes in vitro ont identifié une efficacité virucide de la chlorpromazine sur le MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ou Coronavirus du syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient) [2] , mais son homologie génomique avec le SARS-CoV-2 n'est estimée qu'à 50% [19] .
1, 2 The results of a recent open-label nonrandomized clinical trial by Gautret and colleagues 3 suggest that the addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine significantly reduced polymerase chain reaction detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples by 6 days in 6 patients compared to 14 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone.
In addition, the results from more than 100 COVID-19 patients have indicated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging, promoting virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course [39].
The current advice from the World Health Organization is that either paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to treat symptoms of the illness.
At this point, for women who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with pain not wellcontrolled with acetaminophen, NSAIDs can continue to be used, as the alternative of opioids likely poses more clinical risks.
Keywords: SARS CoV-2, COVID-19, Nitazoxanide, Azithromycin, Interferons Ivermectin ( Fig.
Amantadine would be predicted by physical and chemical properties to accumulate in the lysosomes and raise pH, interfering with cathepsin L function.
Las indicaciones son las mismas que antes de la pandemia, si bien lo que cambia es la forma de estar conectados a nuestros pacientes y que las indicaciones y modificaciones del tratamiento que estos requieran pueden hacerse de manera menos presencial.
[18]Role in PreventionThere is no conclusive evidence as of now about prophylactic value of chloroquine in COVID-19, although there are many queries by health-care workers to start chloroquine 500 mg weekly.
6 No literature data are available on the effect of cyclosporine on the SARS-CoV2, which causes COVID-19, but available data allow us to hypothesize that patients who receive cyclosporine treatment for dermatological autoimmune diseases may benefit from its antiviral activity.
However, only TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host whereas CatB/L activity is dispensable (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019; Shirato et al., 2016; Shirato et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2015) .In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can use CatB/L for cell entry, we initially employed ammonium chloride, which elevates endosomal pH and thereby blocks CatB/L activity.
This finding has been supported by clinical studies conducted in approximately one-hundred SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [7, 8] .Hydroxychloroquine is an analog of chloroquine that has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions.
Hydroxychloroquine therapy is started at a loading dose of 400 mg b.i.d.
These results provide the basis for a rapid test of the beneficial effects of remdesivir in COVID-19.
also analyzed ACI-related markers, including TnI, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, and found that COVID-19 patients who were admitted with increased serum levels of these markers had significantly higher overall mortality rates and shorter survival [8].
In this EClinicalMedicine issue, Dr. Zhao and colleagues describe a 50-year-old Chinese male living with HIV who had evidence of viral shedding for 39 days after symptom onset, but recovered after receiving human immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and inhaled interferon alpha-2b [4] .
The infectious diseases team started hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
Finally, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), pirfenidone, bevacizumab, fingolimod, and bromhexine hydrochloride are going to be tested on COVID-19 (57-61).
Considering these issues and the availability of new long depot formulations, key strategies to best utilise resources during the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting on health services are the following:Providing depot buprenorphine (e.g.
The negative binomial regression remains the optimal model, and shows that ozone, nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide are significantly associated with COVID-19 deaths, together with population density.
The European Medicines Agency concluded that there is currently no scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen or NSAIDs and worsening of COVID-19.
[4] reported that residue 394 (glutamine) in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), corresponding to residue 479 in SARS-CoV, can be recognized by the critical lysine 31 on the human ACE2 receptor [8] .
According to recommendations from an infectious disease specialist, the patient was treated only with supportive measures, including oxygen supplementation, parenteral nutrition, low-dose heparin and corticosteroids (betamethasone 8 mg twice daily).
In our study, apart from lack of benefit, the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir tended to delay viral RNA clearance, even after adjusting for factors including disease severity.
Another study proved Remdesivir and Chloroquine combination to be effective in antagonizing the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2 .
In order to differentiate the COVID-19 immune response from other infectious diseases, thereby identifying the unique COVID-19 immune response, we also recruited one case of influenza A (patient 11), one case of acute pharyngitis (patient 12), and one case of cerebral infarction (patient 13) as controls (Table S1 ).The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of each individual were isolated from the whole blood, and the single-cell mRNA sequencing (ScRNA-Seq) analysis of the PBMCs was performed on the 10 X genomics platform with Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits v1.1 (Fig.
However, after many decades of clinical use of hydroxychloroquine, part of its pharmacokinetics is still unknown, and a number of studies still rely on the drug plasma concentrations [3] , which are not an optimal indicator of the biodistribution of this drug, which is a weak base that becomes readily entrapped in intracellular acidic organelles, due to the Henderson-Hasselbach law [1] .A recent advancement likely to shed more light in the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 with antiviral drugs has been the availability of a mathematical model able to simulate the virus/host interplay and matching clinical observations [4] .
DiscussionChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are already being used extensively, and often in high doses, to prevent and treat COVID19 despite the current lack of convincing evidence of benefit.
Therefore, some authors have suggested that interfering of IL-6 might be a potentially beneficial for severe and critical COVID-19 [2] .A study in two hospitals of Anhui, China that included 21 patients with severe COVID-19 infection treated with Tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy, showed as results a high rate of absorption of lung lesions, decreased C-reactive protein, lymphocytes count in peripheral blood and oxygen requirement and early hospital discharge (13.5 days on average), suggesting that Tocilizumab could be an effective therapy in patients with severe infection, effectively improve clinical symptoms and repress the deterioration of critical patients [4] .
Among the candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repositioning old drugs for use as an antiviral treatment is a compelling strategy, because knowledge about these drugs' safety profile, side effects, pharmacokinetics and drug interactions are already well known [6, 7] .According to an online survey conducted at the end of March, 33% of an international panel of physicians reported personally prescribing (or seeing colleagues prescribe) hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine), and 41% reported the same for azithromycin (or similar antibiotics) to fight COVID-19.
These hydrogen bonds lead to a strong binding of 2019-nCoV protease binding site.
Protein expression and purificationTo express the prefusion S ectodomain, a gene encoding residues 1−1208 of SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank: MN908947) with proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, a "GSAS" substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682-685), a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag was synthesized and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pαH.
The medications of COVID-19 patients before admission included antibiotics (levofloxacin, azithromycin, cephalosporin), antiviral drugs (umifenovir, oseltamivir, acyclovir)and conventional antipyretic drug (ibuprofen).
6‐Brominated coumarin hydrazide‐hydrazone derivatives (BCHHD) were found to be more effective against resistant Panc‐1 cells than doxorubicin (DOX).3 Whereas coumarin derivatives having 4,5‐dihydropyrazole moiety exhibited as potential telomerase inhibition activity against human gastric cancer cell SGC‐7901.4Besides this, indole‐2,3‐diones when joined using alkyl bridges to different heterocyclic moieties have been known to act as SARS coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors.
Interestingly in 82 2005, an old anti-malaria drug "Chloroquine" (CQ) was also shown to sup-83 press SARS/ coronavirus infection in cell culture with IC 50 around 1 μM 84 [5] , although the precise molecular mechanism underlying its anti-viral ac- yet, that PAK1-blockers in general could be useful for the treatment of cur-99 rent "pandemic" COVID-19 infection outbroken from Wohan in China since 100 the end of 2019, which infected over 2,000,000 people world-wide, and 101 whose death toll has reached over 120,000 people (death rate around 102 6%) till now: https://corona.help/103In addition, PAK1 is normally responsible for the suppression of im-104 mune system in hosts [9] .
If chloroquine is to benefit patients with COVID19 it is likely to require high exposures.
It has been demonstrated that serum urea, CREA and CysC could be potential biomarkers that could rapidly and specifically reflect severe COVID-19, and it is of great significance in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 to reduce the mortality and shorten the hospitalization period for patients with severe COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 also has a furin-like protease cleavage site not found in SARS-CoV, between the arginine and serine at positions 685 and 686.
3 One uncontrolled French study of 26 hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab suggested that HCQ, at a dose of 600 mg/day, decreased SARS-CoV-2 shedding and that the combination with azithromycin had further efficacy.
Surface disinfection with 0.1% sodium hypochlorite or 62–71% ethanol significantly reduces coronavirus infectivity on surfaces within 1 min exposure time.
Generally, no significant difference in 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and non-users (30.3% vs. 29.7%, P = 0.910).
Amodiaquine, which was widely used in the past for both prophylaxis and treatment of malaria, was withdrawn from prophylactic use due to rare occurrence of agranulocytosis and hepatitis 44 , and is now only used as a second line acute treatment of P. falciparum-resistant malaria in Africa in combination with author/funder.
Recently, approximately $2 million worth of Kaletra doses were donated to China (16) , and a previous clinical study of SARS by Chu et al.
Human coronaviruses can be efficiently inactivated within 1 min using surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite [85] .Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, control the pandemic, and reduce the economic impact of COVID-19 on China and the world.
27 Separately, the Janus kinas inhibitor baracitinib (but not tofacitinib), may interfere with the virus entering cells by inhibiting AP2-associated protein kinase-1 (AAK1) mediated endocytosis.
The current treatment options for COVID-19 are limited and may not be effective-a randomized trial of lopinavir/ritonavir, a common HIV medication, had no clinical benefit, while clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, and Tocilizumab are ongoing [9] .
Nitazoxanide is both an antiprotozoal agent and a first-in-class broad-spectrum antiviral agent [101] that may be useful for the treatment of MERS infections [102] .It has recently been suggested that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) inhibitors might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients [103] .
Remdesivir is the most promising agent.
"Under this narrative, social distancing will become 'a way of living' with COVID-19 and reflect changing attitudes to prosocial behaviour; very much like our attitudes to recycling, smoking or outdated and dangerous practices, such as the use of laudanum or mercury in the Victorian age.
Apart from the above, lopinavir/ritonavir, nucleoside analogues, neuraminidase inhibitors, remdesivir, and peptide EK1 could also be the choices of antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment [50] .
In addition, emerging data suggest that derivatives of the antimalarial agent quinine such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may help against COVID-19 infection; some of these drugs are actively used in infected dialysis patients.
This cascade of events generates an over-production of immune cells and cytokines, known as cytokine release syndrome, that can lead to a rapidly progressing disease with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock, eventually followed by multiple organ failure [7] .A recent retrospective, multicenter study of 150 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, showed that elevated inflammatory indicators in the blood, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), could be predictors of a fatal outcome in COVID-19, suggesting that mortality might be due to virus-activated 'cytokine-storm syndrome' [6] .
SARS-2-S-driven entry into 293T cells (TMPRSS2-negative) expressing ACE2 was inhibited by ammonium chloride, an inhibitor of CatB/L, while its entry into Caco-2 cells (TMPRSS2-positive) was less efficiently inhibited.
Contents lists available at ScienceDirectResearch in Social and Administrative Pharmacy journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/rsap Cannabidiol as prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19?
Subsequently, other clinical trials suggested that hydroxychloroquine supplementary with azithromycin is very operative in the management of the COVID-19.
After failing to show signs of recovery, oseltamivir was administered to relieve the cough and fever symptoms and reduce the severity of these symptoms in the second stage of COVID-19 infection [8] .
Metformin: mechanism of action on molecular levelMetformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatocytes by causing its phosphorylation.
The viral polymerase nsp12 looks an excellent targetfor new therapeutics, especially given that lead inhibitors already exist in the form ofcompounds such as Remdesivir.
The base paired with the bound ligand and a serine nearby are shown as sticks too.
Les recommandations récentes de la Société franç aise de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO) préconisent de prioriser dans la mesure du possible les patients dont l'objectif thérapeutique est curatif et dont la tumeur primitive n'a pas été encore opérée (cancers ORL, gynécologiques ou bronchopulmonaires notamment) [1] .
There was a single SAE potentially attributed to remdesivir, which was infusion-related hypotension in a 41-year-old man (50) .Published data describing use of remdesivir for COVID-19 include a case report and case series (60) (61) (62) .
As a countermeasurement, conventional anti-infection and anti-virus treatment was conducted, combined with a one-day intravenous drip of methylprednisolone to avoid developing cytokine storm.
Most rheumatologists perceived that they would change their approach towards management patients with lupus, myositis, systemic-sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, more than spondyloarthritis, fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis ( Table 2 ).The pandemic led 47.5% respondents to reduce the use of biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), whereas only 12.2% reduced the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs).66.5% were more inclined to initiate hydroxychloroquine in patients with borderline indications, while 14% disagreed with this approach (Figure 1 ).
Table 1 lists dosing and safety considerations in older adults for the above medications 14 .Of note, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have received attention for potential prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19.
Remdesivir, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, and Oseltamivir significantly blocked the COVID-19 infection in infected patients.
Among them, two Phase III trials involving remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue inhibitor originally under development for Ebola that has shown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and prevents serious pulmonary complications in vivo, began in March and are scheduled to conclude in May 2020 [10] .
Preliminary reports are showing that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with lopinavir could achieve viral clearance (Lim et al., 2020[6]).
Notably, HIT antibodies and a progressive decrease in PLT were also detected in heparin-naïve patients (i.e., before CRRT or other heparin exposure), even in non-ICU patients (figure 4B), indicating the occurrence of spontaneous HIT in COVID-19 patients, which probably results from virus itself or a secondary bacterial infection, such as PF4-conjugated Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli, or severe tissue damage.
::: DiscussionAIFA has also authorized 2 additional trials: the first trial is the combination of emapalumab, monoclonal antibody anti-gamma interferon with Anakinra, an IL-1 antagonist; in the second trial Sarilumab, an IL6 antagonist, will be used10.In vitro studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2.
In the USA, minorities like African Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of mortality compared to the Caucasian population, largely due to SES disparities [22, 23] .Concerning the alleged anti-viral activities of hydroxychloroquine [23] and its potential protective role against infections [24] , the existing scholarly literature reports contrasting findings even though to date no RCT has shown an unequivocal advantage in preventing or improving the major outcomes in COVID-19 patients [25, 26] .
The patient was first administered ritonavir and lopinavir for 5 days.
Co-purified cellular proteins were subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (AP-LC-MS).
As a routinely-used clinical antibiotics, teicoplanin is well known for its much low toxic and side effects, long half-life in blood plasma, convenient administration, and high safety when used in combination with other antibiotics.
For this reason, a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of concomitant inhibition of IL-1 (Anakinra) and IFNγ (emapalumab) in severe COVID-19 patients has just started (NCT04324021).
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.041228 doi: bioRxiv preprint thioredoxin reductase and induction of ER stress by auranofin could significantly affect SARS-COV-2 protein synthesis (15) .In addition, SARS-COV-2 infection causes acute inflammation and neutrophilia that leads to a cytokine storm with over expression of TNF-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (10) .
Protocols to sustain acute stroke care for COVID-19 patients while mitigating nosocomial transmission are needed.
Although previous studies had shown that some patients with confirmed COVID-19 had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), LDH, D-dimer, myoglobin and troponin I, but there was no statistical significance between the two groups in this study.
All surfaces including standard floor, walls, and objects in COVID-19 isolation areas should be disinfected with solutions that have 1000 mg/L chlorine.
For example, although chloroquine appears to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and has been recommended for clinical use by the National Health Commission of China [61], both chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine have been reported to cause cardiac side effects, including impaired conduction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [62].
Antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir 400/100 mg BID and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg BID was started.
20–22 Antipsychotic medications commonly prescribed in schizophrenia, particularly clozapine, appear to be associated with risk of death from pneumonia related to impaired swallowing, sedation, and hypersalivation, which worsen during the immune response due to a feedback loop that increases clozapine concentrations23; while we are unaware of evidence specifically linking clozapine to deaths from coronaviruses, there is at least a hypothetical risk.
Camostat mesylate has already shown to inhibit replication of influenza and parainfluenza viruses and to prevent the 14 development of pneumonia and viral myocarditis in infected mice (34) .
These results are consistent with the lack of virologic or clinical benefit of chloroquine in a number of viral infections where it was assessed for treatment or prophylaxis with sometimes a deleterious effect on viral replication [5] [6] [7] [8] .In summary, despite a reported antiviral activity of chloroquine against COVID-19 in vitro, we found no evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical benefit of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of our hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19.
On March 30, 2020, has issued an emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat patients hospitalized with .Convalescent plasma treatment was mention once in this review, in a multi-center cohort research of 45 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in Wuhan.
As a consequent, asymptomatic and mild cases of CoViD-19 can prevail as epidemics evolves.
Emodin from genus Rheum and Polygonum67, baicalin from in Scutellaria baicalensis44, 68, nicotianamine from foodstuff (especially “soybean ACE2 inhibitor (ACE2iSB)”) 69, scutellarin 70, tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (TGG) from Galla chinensis and luteolin from Veronicalina riifolia71 markedly inhibited the interaction of SARS-CoV S-protein and ACE2.
A phase 4 clinical trial of arbidol for new coronavirus pneumonia had been registered (NCT04246242).
Additionally, increased loss of potassium levels through urine and increased secretion of aldosterone also result after the intrusion of the virus [35] .
Additionally, the use of oseltamivir was already reported during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, either with or without antibiotics and corticosteroids (30).
Encouragingly, in the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States, treatment with remdesivir was provided intravenously to the patient on the day 7 without any adverse events observed.
TreatmentThere is not enough evidence showing whether hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine has a role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Interestingly, it is substituted by proline in SARSv and phenylalanine in 2019-nCoV (corresponding to F486).
In 2020, in China, in Italy and in the Unites States we found more infections in those areas afflicted by Carbon Monoxide, formaldehyde, Nitrogen Dioxide, and PM2.5.
Consequently, we are witnessing an increase in the number of exposures to the chlorine that results from mixing bleach with other cleaning products.
Per-sulphated heparin (heparin 9) inhibited most strongly of the heparin derivatives, but not as effectively as native heparin.
Severe COVID-19 Infection with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome-Maintain corticosteroids at a dose of 10 mg/day (prednisone equivalent).-Discontinue remaining immunosuppressive therapy.-Resume tacrolimus at 3-5 ng/mL dosages within 72 hours of ventilation withdrawal.
Many drugs (either with cardiac or non-cardiac 131 indications) have the ability to block cardiac potassium currents, impairing ventricular 132 8 repolarisation with subsequent prolongation of the QT-interval and an increased risk for 133 malignant arrhythmias.
Western blot analysis ::: Materials and methodsSeven millilitres of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with a titre of 1.86 × 105 TCID50/ml were pelleted through a 25% sucrose cushion by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000× g for 3 h. The layers of supernatant and sucrose were removed, and the resulting viral pellets were re-suspended in 100 μl PBS.
The investigators recommended that these concentrations, as evidenced through the pharmacokinetic studies for these molecules performed in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received chloroquine at 500 mg per day dose, were clinically achievable.
Although there is no tractable clinical evidence, Kaletra or Aluvia has been proposed as a potential anticoronavirus drug for 2019-nCoV.
Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug, has shown promising antiviral activity against various coronaviruses in vitro and is accessed for activity against SARS-CoV-2 [72,73,74].
Although the mutation D355H did not form hydrogen bonds with any residues from SARS-CoV-2, it simultaneously formed two hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Y41 and the main-chain carbonyl group of G45 on the peptide, which may help stabilize the loop region (a.a. 351-357).. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.
ConclusionsIn this work, the binding pattern and susceptibility of the two HIV-1 protease inhibitorslopinavir and ritonavir in complex with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were fully revealed byall-atom MD simulations, binding free energy estimation, and PIEDA based on the MM/PB(GB)SAand FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* calculations, respectively.
Clinical trials have been launched with antiviral and immunomodulating therapies to evaluate their efficacy and their safety to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection or at least attenuate its pulmonary complications [3, 4] .Based on their experimental properties, chloroquine (CQ) and especially its analog hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been suggested [5] , often associated with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (AZI) for alleged synergistic properties [6] .
hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.
12 Because coronavirus replication requires the action of viral proteases, lopinavir/ ritonavir may be effective by binding to the coronavirus protease to inhibit viral replication.
Based on the clinical data collected from ten hospitals in China (Wuhan, Jingzhou, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Ningbo) involving >100 patients, the authors proposed that chloroquine was a promising therapeutic drug.
Consequently, all swabs used for mini-pooling are removed and collectively placed in one new single media pool tube containing 2 ml of guanidinium thiocyanate buffer, the mini-pool tube, under constant agitation for 5 minutes (Figure 1 ).
Remdesivir shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, and it may compete for RdRp [48] .
Dear Editor,We have read with great interest the case report of a patient with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treated with ocrelizumab that developed COVID-19 without serious complications (Novi et al.
Since COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS may need a long period with ventilator support, ketamine could be considered to be incorporated into the sedation protocol for these patients.
Interestingly, fingolimod, a S1P modulator licensed for MS, is being tested as a treatment for COVID-19 associated ARDS (continued on next page) G. Giovannoni, et al.
In a similar manner, studies to determine the impact of cholesterol and Ca2+ on SARS-CoV-2 would be of interest to guide novel antiviral strategies.
This includes lopinavir/ritonavir, 7,8 chloroquine, 9 remdesivir ,10 as well as interferon (IFN)-α 2 and arbidol (ARB) 4 and combinations of these.
And the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 had been carried out in our hospital, which was helpful for including of chloroquine in updated guideline.
Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug.
It is possible therefore that immunosuppressive agents may actually confer protective effects against this particular virus, yet, the general early management strategy within the transplant community has been to reduce or withhold immunosuppression, particularly mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in transplant recipients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive [3] [4] [5] [6] .
22 As an emerging virus, all the patients received anti-viral agents in Ningbo cohort, including Kaletra (Lopinavir/Ritonavir) and Umifenovir, 9 cases received methylprednisolone to treat high fever, SpO2 ≤93% and hypoxiemia.
Among candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repositioning of old drugs for use as antiviral treatment is an interesting strategy because knowledge on safety profile, side effects, posology and drug interactions are well known [6, 7] .A recent paper reported an inhibitor effect of remdesivir (a new antiviral drug) and chloroquine (an old antimalarial drug) on the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, [8] and an early clinical trial conducted in COVID-19 Chinese patients, showed that chloroquine had a significant effect, both in terms of clinical outcome and viral clearance, when comparing to controls groups [9,10].
5 Oxivir® Tb solution, an enhanced hydrogen peroxide disinfectant, is one of the EPA-registered disinfectants.
Moreover, 2019-nCoV likely does not use mouse or rat ACE2 as its receptor because mouse or rat ACE2 contains a histidine at the 353 position, which does not fit into the virus-receptor interaction as well as a lysine does (Fig.
Compounds 22 and 25 had anti-RSV EC50 values of 7.0 and 2.4 µM, respectively, which makes them equipotent to the reference drug ribavirin (EC50 of 6.7 µM).
Therefore, a potential harmful outcome is more likely to be caused by a more severe infection for which ibuprofen is prescribed, rather than the drug.
As CRS occurred in severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 and all of them showed high levels of IL-6, tocilizumab is used in Covid19 patients at the present time [2].
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 [ACE2] or transmembrane serine protease 2 [TMPRSS2], essential host proteins for SARS-CoV-2 priming and cell entry (66) to modulate the host-pathogen interface.
The final six topics chosen were "Social distancing", "Quarantine", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus", "Face Mask" and "Hydroxychloroquine".
In this part, we want to figure out how COVID-19, Policy Effectiveness, and Stock Emotion react to each other, from the perspective of volatility, by DCC-GARCH.
This is easily explained on the basis of the crystal structures: In theenterovirus 3Cpros, the fluorine can accept a hydrogen bond from Arg39 (ref(30)), whereas in the coronavirus Mpros,there would be electrostatic repulsion from the main-chain carbonyls of residues 186 and188.
Summary of the evidenceTwo RCTs of patients with confirmed COVID-19 with mild pneumonia (e.g., positive CT scan without oxygen requirement) or non-severe infection admitted to the hospital treated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reported on mortality at 14 days, clinical progression (radiological progression on CT scan), clinical improvement, failure of virologic clearance (PCR), and adverse events (both) [11, 12] (Table 1 ).In addition, we identified four publications describing three trials of combination treatment with HCQ plus azithromycin (AZ) among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reporting on the outcomes of mortality, failure of virologic clearance (assessed with PCR test), and adverse events (i.e., significant QT prolongation leading to treatment discontinuation) [13] [14] [15] [16] (Table 2) .One RCT and two case studies reported on treatment with combination lopinavir/ritonavir for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [25] [26] [27] (Table 3) .
The most frequent comedication in this population was corticosteroids (daily intake of more than 20 mg-equivalent dose of prednisolone; 22%).About two-thirds of COVID-19 patients (and all those treated with corticosteroids) were treated for metastatic breast cancer.
Third, residues 455, 486, and 494 are leucine, phenylalanine, and serine in 2019-nCoV RBD, respectively (corresponding to residues 442, 472, and 480 in SARS-CoV, respectively) (Fig.
The most primary symptoms managed in COVID-19 are fever and non-productive cough, therefore the first-line antipyretic agent is Paracetamol and antitussive of choice is guaifenesin [21].
The apparent effect of host immunosuppression on the excessive immune response to the viral trigger may also serve as a model for the development of potentially effective treatments, such as Tocilizumab (28) .
Among the 48 drugs that were evaluated in our study, 24 drugs showed potential antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 with IC 50 values in between 0.1 and 10 µM; Tilorone, Cyclosporine, Loperamide, Mefloquine, Amodiaquine, Proscillaridin, Digitoxin, Digoxin, Hexachlorophene, Hydroxyprogesterone caproate, Salinomycin, Ouabain, Cepharanthine, Ciclesonide, Oxyclozanide, Anidulafungin, Gilteritinib, Berbamine, Tetrandrine, Abemaciclib, Ivacaftor, Bazedoxifene, Niclosamide, and Eltrombopag.
Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA genome copy number by qRT-PCR ::: MATERIALS AND METHODSCell supernatants were harvested in TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA was purified after phase separation by chloroform as recommended by the manufacturer.
8.5.Use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquineChloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine have long been used for the prevention and treatment of malaria and chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis [92] .Both of these drugs are found to be very effective in treating dysregulations caused by a coronavirus in China [63] .
heart disease (n=2), and chronic lung disease (n=2) in the COVID-19 group and diabetes mellitus (n=3), hypertension (n=2), chronic liver disease (n=2), chronic lung disease (n=1), and cerebral infarction (n=1) in the influenza group.b Including lopinavir and ritonavir in the COVID-19 group and oseltamivir or peramivir in the influenza group.c Calculated for patients achieving successful weaning of mechanical ventilation.
To lower the barrier to COVID-19 diagnostics, we devised a method we call CREST (Cas13-based, Rugged, Equitable, Scalable Testing).
Sensitivity analyses excluding 21 patients with preexisting liver disease showed similar results, with the adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for severity being 1.73 (0.94-3.16) and 1.86 (0.58-5.92) in patients with abnormal liver tests and liver injury, respectively (Table not shown) .After similar adjustment, patients with liver injury were at a 9-fold greater risk of severe COVID-19 ( patients with abnormal liver tests and liver injury during hospitalization, respectively (Table not shown) .Moreover, after similar adjustment, patients treated with ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) did not show differential odds for severe disease compared to patients taking other antihypertensive drugs (i.e., nifedipine), with the adjusted OR being 0.70 (95% CI 0.20-2.36; p = 0.56) (Table not shown).Compared to those without the use of the suspected drugs that may lead to liver dysfunction (including antibiotics, NSAIDs, ribavirin, herbal medications, and interferon), no significant evidence showed the use of such drugs led to a higher risk of liver injury (p >0.05 in IPW estimation), except for lopinavir/ritonavir (OR 4.44; 95% CI 1.50-13.17 in multivariable model and 5.03, 1.78-14.23 in the IPW estimation; p <0.01) (Fig.
Measurements of daily average nitrogen dioxide (NO2, μg/m3), carbon monoxide (CO, μg/m3), and particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5, μg/m3) from 1580 sites used to estimate pollution changes between the first quarters of 2019 and 2020.
Table 1 shows the low sequence identity between HIV viral protease and 2019-nCoV protease, which might suggest the limited potential for repurposing Aluvia and Norvir for 2019-nCoV treatment.
Coagulation disorder, characterized by an elevated prothrombin time and d-dimer level, was also frequently observed among COVID-19 patients.
As of now, remdesivir may be considered in patients with severe disease and respiratory failure (8) .
As a part of this, (Table 2) defines some of the other core processes that need to be in place to support laboratory biosafety practices when handling a specimen from a patient under investigation for COVID-19.From the standpoint of the histopathology laboratory, the processing of frozen sections from a possible case of COVID-19 should be performed only in a cryostat where aerosols can be contained while wearing the appropriate PPE.7 Any SARS-CoV-2 in specimens that have been formalin fixed and paraffin embedded, however, should be inactivated based on the previous information reported for the inactivation of SARS-CoV.In conclusion, the emergence of a new pathogen presents a number of challenges and concerns about the unknown characteristics of the pathogen.
iii) How different demography (e.g., age groups, gender classes) react to misinformation about COVID-19 spread and how to utilize this knowledge to combat the misinformation propagation?Several existing literature has proposed different fact determining techniques for analyzing and detecting falsified claims and rumors on social media using: i) Bayesian-based heuristic algorithms [54] , ii) analyzing textual evidence with associated images [71] , and iii) considering physical constraints and temporal dependencies of the evolving truth [72] .
Spectra of heparin (porcine mucosal heparin), its derivative and oligosaccharides were collected in the same buffer at approximately comparable concentrations, since these are disperse materials.
The improvement of severe lung pathology from in vitro and in vivo study by Sheahan [61] might help to improve the illness of patients in severe category of COVID-19, which manifests as an extrapulmonary systemic hyperinflammation syndrome [9] and make remdesivir high potential as drug candidates that would be effective for combating COVID-19.
Despite radical sequence differences for the spike protein sequences overall (only 12.8% identity, well within the range for a random match), the underlined sequence motif KRSFIEDLLFNKV of COVID-19 virus is essentially retained as that sequence, except that alanine (A) replaces phenylalanine (F) in the common cold coronavirus (which is moderately conservative at the surface of a protein) and a conservative leucine for valine substation in one case.
[62] reported chloroquine and remdesivir effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells.
Structural analysis of this polymorphism shows that K26 establishes polar contacts with the first mannose moiety of the ACE2 N90-linked glycan and likely stabilizes the position of the glycan relative to ACE2 (Figure 3b ).
Remarkably, hypericin is on the list of computational identified possible treatments against COVID-19 [30] .
In a single prospective, observational study of 36 patients with COVID-19, those receiving hydroxychloroquine demonstrated higher rates of viral load reduction/disappearance, though no patient centered outcomes were assessed [88] .
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has reiterated that up to now there is no scientific evidence of a link between ibuprofen and the worsening of COVID-19, although the situation will have to be monitored over time [36] .We believe that it is best to be prudent and that it is up to each individual rheumatologist to choose which NSAID or analgesic to use for each specific case.
IntroductionRecently, an article by Caly, Druce (1) reported that ivermectin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro causing a ~5000-fold reduction in viral RNA at 48 h with ivermectin at 5 µM.
1,15 Routine laboratory data in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic are similar to common viral infection: lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated D-dimer, liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase), total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase, with worsening data in ICU cases.
Several bioactive components from the S. cusia root, including strobilanthes A, 3H-benzoxazolinone, and aurantiamide acetate, have exhibited antiviral activity against influenza A and hepatitis B virus infections [5,6].
On this subject which worries the whole world, several questions can arise on the coronavirus itself, the world epidemiological situation and the effectiveness of using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment.
Among the immunosuppressants (ISs), calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as cyclosporine (Cys) and tacrolimus (TAC), which are currently used in the setting of transplantation (11) and Rheumatic Disorders (RMDs) (12) , are supposed to exert also an antiviral activity.
Baseline tests should be arranged including the complete blood count, urine analysis, biochemical tests, creatine kinase, and chest X-ray.
The recent publication of a study evaluating hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 is a useful test case, highlighting the challenges of conducting research during a pandemic.
In-home initiation of buprenorphine is feasible and safe and is supported by new dose titration protocols that eliminate the need for opioid withdrawal (6) .We recommend several additional steps to ensure access to buprenorphine in preparation for shifts in prescribers' work duties or sick leave due to COVID-19 and potential treatment disruptions as patients move in and out of hospitals.
[2] [3] [4] [5] The drug has been approved in China for COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated IL-6 (ChiCTR2000029765) and in Italy, following the outbreak that involved our country from February 21, it was extensively used off-label before the Italian Regulatory Agency of Drug (AIFA, Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) approved a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (Tocilizumab 2020-001154-22).
Remdesivir is distributed to the main target tissue of SARS-CoV-2, the lungsTwo groups of six rhesus macaques were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 strain nCoV-WA1-2020.
J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fFor these 28 cancer patients in Wuhan who also had COVID-19, the lab findings at the time of admission included low blood count (anaemic), leucopenia and lymphopenia [41] .Additionally, low levels of serum albumin, high levels of serum globulin and high lactate dehydrogenase with sensitive C-reactive protein in higher levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also detected [41] .
Using MD simulations, the stability of predicted antibodies were checked and 8 stable antibodies were found that can neutralize COVID-19.In addition, the interpretation of ML model revealed that mutating to Methionine and Tyrosine is highly efficient in enhancing the affinity of antibodies to in Health (CMLH) at Carnegie Mellon University (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/cmlh-cfp) and start-up fund from Mechanical Engineering Department at CMU.
Oseltamivir is classified under a class of medicines known as neuraminidase inhibitors that work by stopping the spread of the virus throughout the body, shortening the time in which the flu symptoms last [68].
For instance, teicoplanin was proposed as a potential treatment in COVID-19 patients and has already shown inhibitory effects on cell entry of Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the past.
HIV protease inhibitors ritonavir and lopinavir have been used, typically in combination with appropriate antibiotics or with IFNα-2b, in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients 7, 17.
Cholecalciferol (D3) oral supplements in doses up to a maximum of 4,000iu/d for short periods are considered safe [ Footnotes Funding and Competing InterestsThis work was conducted pro bono as part of an unfunded, independent international response to the pandemic crisis.
All of these cell lines were maintained and grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco).Patient-derived COVID-19 (BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) was isolated by the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
COVID-19 infection was reported in 9 (15%) in the whole sample, 7 (12,9%) in patients receiving rituximab, and 2 (33,3%) in patients with ocrelizumab.
3Exploration of drugs already introduced into clinical practice inevitably leads to consideration of the potential of colchicine.
While anecdotal, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have shown potential in both prophylaxis and treatment of patients with COVID-19.
Various antiviral drugs have been developed targeting this enzyme for the treatment of infections caused by RNA viruses and they are working effectively [10, 50] .Therefore, this present study aimed to identify potential drugs targeting this enzyme for the treatment of COVID-19.Molecular docking analysis revealed that Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin, 7-methylguanosine-5'-triphosphate-5'-guanosine and Ivermectin could be potential RdRp inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.
Ustekinumab is considered to have less biological effect on viral immunity than anti-TNF in the COVID 19 guidelines.
Among them, chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine have drawn intensive debate 9 .
Both anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies (tocilizumab, and a human monoclonal antibody sarilumab (Kevzara®)), and anti-IL-6 antibody siltuximab (Sylvant®) are under evaluation in COVID-19 patients at various centers (Table 1 ).
The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, produced in a partnership between The University of Oxford's Jenner Institute and Italian pharmaceutical manufacturer Advent Srl, consists of an attenuated adenovirus capable of producing the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, allowing for the formation of endogenous antibodies against these proteins and, consequently, against SARS-CoV-2 [80] .Currently, there is no conclusive evidence that ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory drugs increases the risk of serious complications or of acquiring the virus that causes COVID-19.
Ces informations, bien que cohérentes au regard de données méta-analytiques plus récentes [57] , méritent d'être nuancées en termes d'ajustements posologiques par au moins deux aspects :• en cas de fièvre, symptômes pseudo-grippaux, évocateurs de la COVID-19, et de signes de surdosage en clozapine ou olanzapine, des ajustements posologiques plus importants et/ou plus rapides pourraient s'avérer nécessaires [43] ; • il est par ailleurs démontré l'influence génétique sur le niveau d'inductibilité du CYP1A2 par le tabagisme (phénotypique -gènes impliqués dans les voies de régulation du CYP1A2 -et génotypique -rôle du polymorphisme − 163C>A sur l'inductibilité du CYP1A2, en particulier chez les fumeurs ; [58] ).Ces éléments devant inciter à prendre en considération l'évolution clinique individuelle (en se basant idéalement, en fonction de la disponibilité/rapidité d'accès, sur du monitoring plasmatique), prioritairement à tout schéma d'adaptation standardisé.La prise en considération de ce phénomène peut également intégrer la consommation de cannabis, puisque le tabac et le cannabis induisent tous deux le CYP1A2 et que l'effet d'induction entre les deux produits semble additif [54] .
Three combinations were deemed effective: sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin, all of which consisting of at least one anti-cancer agent (an immunosuppressant, an antineoplastic agent and a selective estrogen receptor modulator respectively) (11) .Amidst this rapid evolution of the COVID-19 should be kept in mind the need to respect some clinical research ethics.
Those residues should be able to accommodate sofosbuvir (Figures 3d-f , similarly to HCV polymerase, Figure 3a -c), but the overall size of the pocket may be small for the larger compound remdesivir (see Figure S1 in Supplementary material).
The importance of TMPSRR2 is supported by the evidence that entry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into cells is partially blocked by camostat mesylate, an inhibitor of TMPSRR2.
85To determine the most effective treatments for COVID-19 and ensure sufficient power toobserve definitive results, the WHO announced the SOLIDARITY clinical trial, a four-armtrial comparing remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir withinterferon-β1a, and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (ISRCTN83971151).
The Wuhan Virus Research Institute conducted in vitro experiments on COVID-19 of remdesivir and found that remdesivir was the fastest-acting and most powerful antiviral agent.
She was started on hydroxy-chloroquine along with azithromycin immediately and continued on mechanical ventilation with ARDS protocol.
Results for biochemical examination are: lactate dehydrogenase 69U/L[, a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 258U/L[, creatine kinase 139U/L, creatine kinase isoenzyme 41U/L, C-reactive protein 15.2 mg/L[, serum amyloid >300 mg/L[, procalcitonin 0.28 ng/mL (see Figs.
Combination therapy with mAbs and the drug remdesivir could be an ideal therapeutic option for COVID-19.40 Further evaluation is required before confirming the efficacy of such combination therapy.
Repurposed drugs used for treatment of COVID-19 consisted of 6 drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir and chloroquine) and 4 TCMs (Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang).
Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been touted for potential prophylaxis or treatment for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) infection.
The high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 and these comorbidities prompted us to probe the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 attaches and interacts with membrane bound and cell free forms of ACE2.At present, a combination of two known drugs namely Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are promising therapeutic interventions used for management of COVID-19 patients (Gautret P et al, 2020) .
Furthermore, specifically concerning patient 2, the patient was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy, which involves greater immunosuppression and could be a predisposing factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Indeed, there are several studies indicating that upon intravenous administration, almitrine is effective in human ARDS by increasing arterial PO2 if the rise in pulmonary artery pressure is adequately supported by the right ventricle and cardiac output does not fall (7) .Unfortunately, almitrine is not available in Switzerland.
COVID-19 could alter blood levels of certain psychotropic drugs, such as clozapine or lithium.
This result should also discourage the use of other protease inhibitors (e.g., darunavir), at least until results of dedicated RCT are available.
In the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases, chloroquine can cause numerous side effects such as nausea, headache, pruritus, worsening of psoriasis, retinopathy, and cardiac dysfunction.
Abstract:There is anecdotal evidence that tocilizumab, an immunosuppressant drug, may be a potential therapeutic option for patients with severe manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
16 In view of the fact that the active triphosphate form of TAF, Tenofovir diphosphate, is much smaller than natural nucleoside triphosphates, we expect that it can easily fit within the active site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
Figure#: Cough, fever, shortness of breath, malaise, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, sore throat or rhinorrhea during quarantine or on the day of surgery PAPR Legend *: Frequent, serial re-evaluation of necessary surgical PPE according to patient-and surgical-risk will be required, particularly with improvements in management of patient-level risk.
Les traitements immunosuppresseurs (adalimumab (1/13), etanarcept (4/13), abatacep (2/13), tocilizumab (1/13), tafacitinib (2/13) et baricitinib (3/13)) avaient été arrêtés dès l'apparition des symptômes pour ces huit patients.
This raises a concern that the supply of tocilizumab may become limited, prompting rationing among patients with COVID-19 and patients with other FDA-approved indications.
Hence, we predict that the readily available and approved inhibitors (Amantadine, Hexamethylene amiloride and SB203580), that proved efficient for alleviating ARDS in SARS-CoV-1-infected animal models should also be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
A systematic review suggested the rationale, pre-clinical supporting evidence of the effectiveness against SARS-CoV-II, and the clinical J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof safety profiles, that justify future clinical research of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19 [114] .There are currently several clinical trials of chloroquine for COVID-19, either as monotherapy or in combination with other medications such as azithromycin [112] .
It is also exciting to uncover that Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) Adeflavin, B2 Deficiency medicine, and Coenzyme A, a coenzyme, may also be potentially used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Our previous work revealed that the activity of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which activates several coronaviruses Gierer et al., 2013; Glowacka et al., 2011; Matsuyama et al., 2010; Shirato et al., 2013 Shirato et al., , 2016 Shulla et al., 2011) , is also required for robust SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020) .
Some polymerase inhibitors [29, 30] are currently being tested in clinical studies to target SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, including Favipiravir [17, 19], Galidesivir [18], Remdesivir [19], Ribavirin [20], Penciclovir [31], Galidesivir [32] and Ponatinib [33].
After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, screening of approved drugs identified at least two human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir and nelfinavir, as compounds that inhibited SARS-CoV replication in vitro 3, 4 .
This 196 phenomenon is primed by the multifunction serine protease TMPRSS2 20 .
Such entry depends on priming by the serine protease transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) (Fig.
This feature increases its potential as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 [46] .The antiviral agent, remdesivir was designed for the Ebola virus disease [47] .
As with oseltamivir treatment for influenza, which fails to provide a protective effect if administered >5 days after the onset of symptoms, the window in when to treat COVID-19 patients before peak virus replication is likely during the first week of symptoms when pharyngeal shedding is at its highest (41, 42).
Further, it can form several hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues in the substrate-binding pocket.
59,64 Hydroxychloroquine (with or without adjunctive azithromycin) has also been claimed to be effective in patients with COVID-19, but this study had several major shortcomings.
Previous retrospective studies indicated that an elevated level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was associated with a high case fatality of COVID-19 infection [1] .
A recent study reported 14-53% cases with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the liver of COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) .
The main drug hydroxychloroquine studied here is claimed effective against the SARS-CoV-2 [11] and therefore, its dock score compared with the other tested molecules.
Cases in Vietnam, Thailand and United States [22,44], have been reported where patients received antivirals, such as remdesivir [44], among other drugs including oseltamivir; clinical trials of antivirals and vaccines are ongoing for MERS-CoV and one controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir monotherapy for 2019-nCoV (ChiCTR2000029308) [45], at the Wuhan's Jin Yintan Hospital [46] is in progress.
PatientsEligible patients were men and non-pregnant women with COVID-19 who were aged at least 18 years and were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, had pneumoniaResearch in contextEvidence before this study We searched PubMed, up to April 10, 2020, for published clinical trials assessing the effect of remdesivir among patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 .

Wang et al [3] evaluated the in vitro activity of ribavirin against SARS-CoV-2 and found an EC50 of 109.5 µM, which was over 100 times less potent than remdesivir.
Despite these findings, there has been a study going on to repurpose the utility of sofosbuvir, a ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor used in the treatment of hepatitis C along with ribavirin in COVID-19 patients.
In African green monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, remdesivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 0·46 µg/mL and an EC 90 of 1·06 µg/mL.
Another question this study raises is the possibility of the existence of certain resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2 that did not respond to hydroxychloroquine treatment.
Although there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, some potential drugs are widely in use, including an antiviral drug remdesivir, the malaria medication chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, a combination of the HIV drugs lopinavir–ritonavir, and an immune system messenger interferon-β.
Owing to several similar consults in COVID-19 patients with borderline or increased QTc intervals, we developed a flow chart that addresses QT interval management in order to help clinicians taking care of COVID-19 patients who require chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin ( Figure 3 ).
In addition to common bacteria, azithromycin and clarithromycin have demonstrated to be also active against some unexpected pathogens (e.g., Borrelia burgdorferi, Toxoplasma gondii, Mycobacterium avium complex, and M. leprae), and maybe also for SARS-CoV-2 [46].
In addition, several case reports of QT prolongation related to hydroxychloroquine have also been published [17] [18] [19] [20] .In another prospective cohort study in 224 COVID-19 uninfected patients with SLE who received either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for routine care, gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 7% of patients [21] .Several case reports have been published citing the risk of a prolonged QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia in patients receiving azithromycin alone.
For another HIV-PI, lopinavir, uncontrolled studies have indicated a potential benefit in COVID-19 with early initiation [22] [23] [24] .
Culture medium without exposure to the heparin blood collected tubes was used for control dilution series.
The results of the time-of-addition assay indicated that CVL218 can partially work against the viral entry and significantly inhibit the replication of virus post-entry, while the remdesivir can only function at the post-entry stage ( Figure 2D , 2E).

As shown in Table 5 , creatinine and urea nitrogen were increased in patients with lymphocyte reduction.
However, the arginine (R426 in SARS-CoV RBD) to asparagine (N439) mutation in 2019-nCoV RBD abolished the strong polar interactions, which may induce a decrease in the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor.
Cysteine C should be avoided (perhaps replaced by serine S) not least because of the formation of unwanted Cys-Cys S–S disulfide bonds, although at either end of the peptide a Cys (C) already present or added can provide the link to a carrier protein that is essential for B immune system antibody response and T system memory.
In China, drugs that were recommended were primarily HCQ but also α-interferon, lopinavir, ritonavir and umifenovir [27] , in Korea, recommended drugs were lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine [28] .
However, no studies, neither in vitro nor in vivo, have been conducted on the combined effect of HCQ and ivermectin on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Moreover, a possible correlation between tocilizumab and medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws was reported in patients with osteoporosis [48] .Given the efficacy of tocilizumab in CRS and the pivotal role of IL-6 in COVID-19, we propose to repurpose tocilizumab to treat severe cases of COVID-19.
IntroductionChloroquine, and its hydroxy-analog hydroxychloroquine, was first proposed in 2003 for treatment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] and, due to its promising in-vitro effects [2] , was then repurposed as a drug for treatment of COVID-19.
The infectious diseases team was consulted and the patient commenced a 5-day course of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine once the SARS-CoV-2 test was confirmed to be positive.
However, the WHO declared on March 18, 2020 under a post titled 'Anti-inflammatory drug has been subject of conflicting reports' that 'there's no evidence to suggest that using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of COVID-19 will worsen the condition'.
Studies on SARS-CoV (30, 31) shows that Interferon-beta and interferon-gamma synergistically inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus.

If we assume each country has immediately isolated all the reported cases imported from Wuhan (and therefore truncated transmission), but not isolated the extra cases we estimated and that no extra control measures are put in place, we estimate that the chance that local transmission would occur and sustain for at least three generations exceeds 50% for a total of 16 countries or territories, including four outside Asia: Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and United States ( Table 2 ).
[92] At priori trypsin, cleavage of S protein is essential for a successful viral entry.
In isolation, these in vitro data are robust and encouraging but the report does not include a correlation of the in vitro findings with clinically achievable plasma and, more relevantly, lung concentrations that would permit the determination of whether the macrocyclic lactones (and specifically in this case ivermectin) are genuine therapeutic options.
Old age, hypertension, interleukin-6, and CD8 + T cell exhaustion were significantly associated with the development of pneumonia.

Dear Editor:Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) and COVID-19 infection share similar clinical and imaging findings.
However, the anti-SARS-CoV2 action of chloroquine does not seems to account for the significant efficiency to critically ill patients in our cohort.
For cell lines derived from lung tissues (A549 and HCC515), the drugs with the highest overlap with COVID-19 targets are mitoxantrone and ponatinib.
Currently, several drugs such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, Ritonavir+Lopinavir, Arbidol and interferon are undergoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to test their efficacy and safety for the treatment of COVID-19 in many countries [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .
8, 9 Hydroxychloroquine has some immunomodulatory action and after the outbreak, studies have shown some activity of this drug.
Thus, certain researchers have proposed that the anti-HIV drug, lopinavir, may play a role in inhibiting COVID-19.
The epidemiologist Nanshan Zhong, who is credited with discovering the SARS coronavirus in 2003 and is advising on the management of the COVID-19 outbreak, has said that chloroquine phosphate is not a highly effective cure but its effects deserve attention, even though its pharmaceutical mechanism remains unclear.
The standard regimen for unfit CLL patients usually includes an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and chlorambucil.
In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, future work is needed to assess the efficacy of an ozone treatment in order to reduce the transmission of this virus in hospital settings and other indoor public spaces.
2, 3The case presented here illustrates that in a relatively healthy individual, tofacitinib may not need to be held in patients with COVID-19 without severe disease.
Les données sont encore parcellaires notamment sur le cycle de vie du SARS-CoV-2, ses modes de transmission et leur importance relative au cours des stades cliniques du COVID-19.
Recent structure-based computational studies hypothesized that almitrine binds to the SARS-CoV-2 main viral proteinase (Mpro, or 3CLpro), an important viral target given the necessity of this protein for viral replication [15] [16] [17] .
A molecular dynamics simulation suggested that lopinavir and ritonavir are able to inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CL pro enzyme (required for the processing of the SARS-CoV polyprotein containing the replicase enzyme) by binding to the enzyme's active site, with neither of them having a higher binding affinity than the other [35].

6, 7 Nevertheless, the United States Food and Drug Administration used its emergency authority for only the second time ever to permit the use of a drug for an unapproved indication 8 in the case of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 in situations where clinical trials are unavailable or infeasible.
Another anti-virus drug, Remdesivir showed efficacy by resisting two viruses similar to Covid-19, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in animals [58] .
Once activated by SARS-CoV-2, this protease helps virus 1) to reduce autophagy, the process physiologically aimed to eliminate external microorganisms from the host cells, 2) to sustain the hyper-inflammatory status and 3) to reduce the host anti-viral immune response [35] .
In particular, arbidol inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication by 21.73% at 3 µM, much lower than that of CVL218 at the same concentration ( Figure 2A ).
By contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a cysteine protease (Protein Data Bank-code 6LU7) and while several docking poses have been found for DRV in in silico models, unlike in HIV, these poses showed little interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease active site.
Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)• There are no data to suggest patients with CPVT are at increased risk from COVID-19 infection.• We recommend CPVT patients continue their regular cardiac medications.• We recommend avoidance of epinephrine in the setting of a ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest where possible.

Certain drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and remdesivir, are being tested in clinical trials [7] [8] [9] .
97.1% infected patients received single or combined antiviral, including baloxavir, favipiravir, darunavir, arbidol, or interferon alpha inhalation.
The trials will include 3200 patients in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, France, and Spain, to test the clinical efficacy of the antiviral drugs remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir (+/−interferon), and hydroxychloroquine (NCT04315948).
Although it is an approved treatment for influenza, less preclinical support has been established for favipiravir to treat SARS-CoV-2 compared to remdesivir.
Ces adaptations pourraient s'avérer sécures en période de pandémie au SARS-CoV-2, pouvant générer des doutes sur les conséquences de l'hyperthermie, voir des risques de confusion entre symptomatologie virale et intoxication au lithium.
Nowadays, The effective concentrations (EC90) of chloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells is 6.90 μM [15], which is clinically achievable, well-tolerated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and potentially applicable to COVID-19 patients, as we did.
Hydroxychloroquine is safer and more potent in terms of in vitro SARS-CoV-2 suppression.
Debido a que los niveles de interleucina 6 (IL 6) están elevados en pacientes con neumonía COVID-19 semejando una tormenta de citoquinas, se ha propuesto la investigación con tocilizumab (antagonista de IL 6) 42 .La última y más reciente publicación del Instituto de Cardiología de la Universidad de Brescia en Italia, hecha por Metra et al.

The theoretical, CD spectrum that resulted from the arithmetic addition of the CD spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD and that of the heparin differed from the observed experimental CD spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD mixed with heparin.
As in humanitarian crises, spiritual care during COVID-19 will include helping individuals face and overcome fears and find hope and meaning; attending to existential suffering; addressing feelings of punishment, guilt, unfairness, and remorse; assisting when people need to confess or reconcile; and offering grief support and death preparation assistance (24) .
All the patients in TOCI group were already treated with tocilizumab before the subsequent enrolment into the retrospective part of the TOCIVID-19 Italian study (EudraCT: 2020-001110-38), a single arm, open-label trial on the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in COVID-19 pneumonia.
We found that only remdesivir shows inhibitory effect, consistent with our MD simulations.
Patients were sent to the ED if they met the following criteria: (1) hemodynamic instability, (2) volume depletion, (3) hypoxia with O2 saturation <94% on RA and/or (4) acute kidney injury (as defined by an increase of creatinine to ≥ 0.5mg/dL above baseline or a 30% increase from baseline).
Additionally, it has been found that remdesivir treatment during COVID-19 can also induce liver impairment.
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as Baricitinib, Fedratinib, and Ruxolitinib, indicated for Rheumatoid Arthritis and Myelofibrosis, have been tested in xenograft models for Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy induced CRS 25 .
Although corticosteroids are not recommended for COVID-19, stress dose methylprednisolone was added for refractory septic shock.
29 Nevertheless, the safety and side-effect profile of remdesivir in patients with Covid-19 require proper assessment in placebo-controlled trials.
Cell were washed twice with PBS and media containing different concentrations of auranofin (Sigma) or DMSO (Sigma) was added to cells.
2020.03.024, PMID XXXX) offers an algorithm for the use of potentially QT-prolonging medicines such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, and the antiviral combination lopinavir/ritonavir.
Given that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is activated by the pH dependent cysteine protease cathepsin L, this processing step may be sensitive to inhibition with drugs that indirectly inhibit cathepsin L activity by interfering with endosomal acidification (e.g.
Use of A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 21 remdesivir under Single Patient Expanded Access ("compassionate use") requests, the major mechanism currently available to patients <18 years of age, offers the additional advantages (relative to off-label use of other antivirals) of a mechanism for monitoring at least serious adverse events (SAEs) through data collection by the manufacturer, oversight by local Institutional Review Boards, and a requirement for informed consent.
Moreover, adalimumab could be useful not only in maintain IBD remission during COVID-19, but also potentially useful in managing/preventing COVID-driven pneumonia.
This strategy has identified several genomic regions of interest Glossary Adalimumab: mAb targeted against TNF-α; an immunosuppressant commonly used in inflammatory conditions.
Interestingly, ivermectin therapy has been shown to reverse onchocerciasis-associated immunosuppression through sustained production of IFN-γ in amicrofilaridermic individuals 5 , to be also noted that it was previously shown that recombinant human IFN-γ had a particular effect on the incidence of herpes simplex, and 7 8 .
The Arginine (R) in the conserved motif KRSFIEDLLFNKV that was of interest in the previous study [2] is the cleavage point in S2'.Recall that the KRSFIEDLLFNKV subsequence associated with S2' is potentially important, not least because it must be exposed or exposable (because it permits proteolytic cleavage) and therefore the site cannot be well shielded.
These findings are comparable with our in vitro chloroquine results of an EC50 value of 5.47 μM.
in a cohort of 29 Chinese patients: the levels of IL-2R and IL-6 in peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were significantly increased and related to the severity of the disease [252] .Even though tocilizumab does not seem to have any direct anti-viral effect, the elevated serum levels of IL-6 in severe COVID and the evidence of a cytokine pattern similar to CRS led to the hypothesis of the use of this drug as treatment of severe respiratory infections whose manifestations could be correlated to the abnormal innate immune response stimulated by IL-6.
Recent study showed that with EC 50 of 1.13 mmol/L and SI greater than 88, chloroquine can effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the cell level.
Another point that we would like to highlight is that much attention is being given to possible COVID-19 treatments, and the association of chloroquine and azithromycin is one of the most studied, being used off-label worldwide (4).
In addition, remdesivir also predicted to bind with the human TMPRSS2, a protein facilitating the virus infection, this is a new discovery and provides ideas for subsequent research.
Sulfadoxine inhibits the activity of dihydropteroate synthase within the malaria parasite, but its mechanism of action for SARS-CoV-2 is unclear.
It's reasonable that these patients undergo systematic testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of treatment In 2019, a Meta-analysis of metronomic oral vinorelbine has been published (6): 9 studies, in first and second line, was selected to be included.
We have not explored the phylogenetic basis for the presence of tyrosines but they do seem to be important for conferring high binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 as alluded to by the alanine scan (see Figure 2 ).
Thus, these data may be of interest for ongoing clinical trials on tocilizumab effects on Covid-19 patients and for the optimal control of glycemia in this subset.
This increases the flexibility of the protein backbone.• -PP to GVE at index 482-484 of SARS-CoV-2: The insertion of Glycine and the substitutions of two Proline amino acids clearly make this segment much more flexible.
It is proposed that the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein to the functional receptor ACE2 results in proteolytic cleavage by type II transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS2).
In this study, we compared the sex-related hormones between reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and age-matched healthy men, and found serum luteinizing hormone (LH) was significantly increased, but the ratio of testosterone (T) to LH and the ratio of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to LH were dramatically decreased in male with COVID-19.
Serine Protease inhibitors:Given the TMPRSS2 involvement in viral entry (Figure 2) , serine protease inhibitors such as Camostat are now under evaluation in trials and should also be considered in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
This makes the virus able to interact with high airways and then reach the low airway cells [38] .The recognition between spike and sialic acids occurs via a conserved groove which plays a key role for S MERS-CoV-mediated attachment to sialosides and entry into human airway epithelial cells [33] .Since the interaction of MERS-CoV spike and the sialic acids is caused mainly by hydrogen bonds and shape complementarity [39] , our method is particularly suitable to find on the SARS-CoV-2 spike surface a region similar to the one involved in binding of the sialic acid in MERS-CoV spike.
Ammonium chloride (A) blocks endosomal acidification while E-64d and camostat mesylate (B) block the activity of CatB/L and TMPRSS2, respectively.
Expectation and attention were shifted to "remdesivir" which may be the most potential wide-spectrum drug for antiviral treatment of 2019-nCoV.
As a result, we identified two small natural products, baicalin and baicalein, as the first class of noncovalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by the enzymatic assay in combination with the ITC, ESI-MS, and X-ray protein crystallography studies.
We have recently reported that two drugs, remdesivir (GS-5734) and chloroquine (CQ) phosphate, efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro 1 .
These drugs could form hydrogen bonds with one or more residues among Thr24-Asn28 and Asn119, therefore theoretically, are capable to bind to the pocket formed by these amino acids and interfere the function of 2019-nCoV M pro .In summary, based on the structural information of clinical effective medicines for 2019-nCoV, we have predicted a list ofJournal of Genetics and GenomicsJ o u r n a l h o me p a g e : w w w .
Current evidence ::: Main textA recent article published in Chinese found no benefit with chloroquine in a 1:1 randomized trial with 30 patients [6].
Currently, six studies are looking at the use of antivirals, such as umifenovir, antimalarials, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and the use of recombinant human interferon alpha (a)1b spray for the prevention of infection (Table 1B : Antiviral and Antimalarial).
SARS-2-S-driven entry into lung cells is also inhibited by camostat mesylate.
At this juncture, no evidence can support switching patients with controlled asthma to inhaled ciclesonide or mometasone.
20 Certain biologics, notably tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin (IL)-6R antibody, may have some efficacy to prevent death.
Both tests, at our facility and the outside hospital, resulted positive and patient was started on hydroxychloroquine 400 mg for the first two doses with subsequent 200 mg dose twice a day for an additional eight doses.
It should be emphasized that chloroquine has been advocated as a potentially effective drug to be administered in CIVID-19 associated pneumonia [28] .
However, no evidence exists as to the effects of indomethacin in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
There have also been increased concerns regarding the potential for increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in patients taking medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists, that upregulate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (3) .
If clinical data confirm the biological results, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be used in prophylaxis as well as curative treatment for individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 [71] .
Nebulised heparin is administered 6-hourly to day 10 while the patient is receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.

Figure S-2.
LPV, RTV and remdesivir target viral enzymes, while the actions of CQ and IFN-β target host cells.
19 Coronaviruses partially resistant to inhibition by remdesivir (about six-times increased EC 50 ) have been obtained after serial in vitro passage, but these viruses remain susceptible to higher remdesivir concentrations and show impaired fitness.
This IL-6 overproduction is the justification for using IL-6 receptor antagonists such as tocilizumab in COVID-19 clinical trials.
According to preliminary reports [50 , 51] from the Chinese authorities suggesting that approxi-mately 100 infected patients treated with chloroquine experienced a more rapid decline in fever and improvement of lung computed tomography (CT) images and required a shorter time to recover compared with control groups, with no obvious serious adverse effects, the Chinese medical advisory board has suggested chloroquine inclusion in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment guidelines.
Niclosamide and Coronavirus ::: Niclosamide and Viral InfectionsCoronaviruses are a group of enveloped and nonsegmented positive-sense RNA viruses withvery large genome size ranging from approximately 27 to 34 kb.
Figure 1H , E indeed show that naproxen can also bind at this interface in both MERS-CoV and SARS-Cov-2, respectively, but an additional binding site in SARS-CoV-2 monomer was also identified (Sup.
[20] reported their case series of 5 COVID-19 cases in France, of whom 3 with at least severe illness requiring ICU monitoring received remdesivir.
Given the broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity of remdesivir that were demonstrated in pre-clinical studies; a randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trial is planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 respiratory disease [12] and this trial has already involved 308 hospitalized adult patients.
Also shown in this table are journal articlespertaining to potential antiviral drug candidates such as remdesivir, baricitinib, and chloroquine for the treatment of this disease.
Mouth rinse containing oxidative agents such as 0.2% povidone or 1% hydrogen peroxide is recommended due to the vulnerability of COVID-19 to oxidation (9) .
Likewise, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been labelled as potential 587 "game changers" and are being evaluated for treatment of severe COVID-19 patients (104).
Remdesivir and chloroquine[33ref33bibr] ::: Recent Advances in the Treatment of 2019-Novel CoronavirusUsing clinical isolates of 2019-nCoV, Wang et al., 2020 evaluated the efficacy of seven agents (ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, chloroquine, remdesivir [GS5734], and favipiravir [T-705]) in in vitro conditions.
The antiviral activity of nitazoxanide for SARS-CoV-2 requires further study but the existing data for this drug are encouraging.
Chloroquine is being considered for inclusion in the next versions of the guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID.
An in vitro study testing the effects of seven drugs on the infection rate of the COVID-19 reported that chloroquine, an anti-malarial agent, and remdesivir, an anti-Ebola drug, effectively inhibited the 2019-nCoV infection [32].
Therefore, a number of clinical trials have been quickly conducted in China, which demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine was to various degree effective in treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
Two trials of losartan as additional treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized (NCT04312009) or not hospitalized (NCT04311177) patients have been announced, supported by the background of the huge adverse impact of the ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis over-activity in these patients.
In recent years, colchicine has attracted attention in the management of cardiovascular diseases by suppressing their inflammatory component [92].
Respiratory viral panel, including influenza, was negative, but a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test that was sent while the patient was in the ED returned positive on day 4.The patient was initially admitted to the progressive care unit under droplet and contact precautions pending SARS-CoV-2 test results, and ceftriaxone and azithromycin were initiated for presumed community-acquired pneumonia.
The inhibition potentials of all these plant extracts are found to be larger than those of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
Therefore, the likelihood of a successful clinical trial using the approved dose of ivermectin is low.
Following is a list of some proteins with potentially druggable SPs, including relevant therapeutic applications in parentheses: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-ACE2 (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), hemagglutinin (H1N1 influenza), MARTX protein (cholera), plasmepsin X (malaria), GP160 (HIV Bal R5, NL4.3 X4), ANTR1 (anthrax), integrin alpha-IIb (anticoagulant), fibrinogen alpha chain (anticoagulant), sclerostin (osteoporosis), CX3CR1 (Alzheimers), amyloid beta (Alzheimers), complement 5 (rheumatoid arthritis), GM-CSF (rheumatoid arthritis), thyroglobulin (hyperthyroidism), myostatin/GDF-8 (muscle loss), growth arrest-specific protein-Gas1 (muscle loss), CAMPATH-1 antigen/CD52 (multiple sclerosis), glycoprotein B/gB (cytomegalovirus), kirrel 3 (autism/intellectual disability), candidialysin (Candida albicans toxicity), cadherin 10 (autism), thyroid stimulating hormone receptor-TSHR (Grave’s disease), and toll-like receptor 4-TLR4 (anxiety, neurodegenerative diseases, stroke recovery).
Whilst still controversial, ACE inhibitors and ibuprofen may increase ACE2 levels [34] , potentially facilitating COVID-19 infection, and are of interest because of their use in the management of migraine.
The authors do not suggest the use of oseltamivir for COVID-19 in that publication, and there are no data that suggest in vitro activity of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2.
There are other laboratory tests for the status of 2019-nCoV infection, including blood gas analysis, liver and kidney function, myocardial enzyme, myoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), lactate, D-dimer, coagulation image, urine routine test, inflammatory factors (interleukin(IL)-6, IL-10, TNF - α), 11 items of tuberculosis (TB) subgroup, complement, anti-acid staining, etc.
Similarly, favipiravir demonstrates efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, and currently the drug is in randomized trials with interferon-α and baloxavir marboxil for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Li and De Clercq 2020).
2018), it is of distinct interest that a recent clinical study reports that hydroxychloroquine therapy exerts beneficial therapeutic effects in COVID-19 infection (Gao et al.
Evidence on the Safety of Ibuprofen in Patients With COVID-19The evidence behind this controversy comes anecdotally from an infectious diseases specialist in France who reported four cases of worsening symptoms of COVID-19, 1 which we could not identify in the published literature.
Routine blood examinations were complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), myocardial enzymes, interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum ferritin, andResearch in contextEvidence before this study We searched PubMed on Feb 23, 2020, for articles that documented the risk factors of mortality and viral shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the search terms ("novel coronavirus" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "COVID-19") AND ("death" OR "mortality" OR "viral shedding") with no language or time restrictions.

The number of drugs and combinational therapies were identified by using previously approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, targeting viral protease, regulating immunity, inhibiting the inflammatory cytokine surge, improving pulmonary function and reducing lung viral loads, as an inhibitor of the host cell serine protease and angiotensin receptor blockers, lower the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells (Table 1) .
Since there is an urgent need for the severe COVID-19 treatments, based on these limited data, tocilizumab is included in the treatment algorithms of many countries.
Based on the reported genome sequence of 2019-nCoV(4), we expressed ectodomain 37 residues 1−1208 of 2019-nCoV S ( Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure 1) , adding two stabilizing 38 proline mutations in the C-terminal S2 fusion machinery based on a previous stabilization 39 strategy which proved highly effective for betacoronavirus S proteins (11, 14) .
This is in part because a large study screening existing FDA approved drugs for repurposing as antiviral therapeutics reported three different immunosuppressive agents widely used in transplant recipients-tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and sirolimus-as potential therapies for Covid-19 [1] .Moreover, in vitro studies have demonstrated that mycophenolic acid has activity against other coronaviruses, namely MERS-CoV [2] .
Hence, only remdesivir can inhibit RNA synthesis in RdRp and simultaneously avoid its excision by the ExoN of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
30, 31 Based on these evidence, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial was recently registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029765) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IL-6R blockade with tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19.As mentioned above, inhibiting dysregulated inflammatory response represents a promising therapeutic strategy for both COVID-19 and hypertension patients.

90 Moreover, chloroquine was also found to be a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection through interfering with ACE2, one of cell surface binding sites for S protein of SARS‐CoV.
Although most neurologists consider natalizumab relatively safe there is a small increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections on this medication (Kapoor et al., 2018; Polman et al., 2006; Rudick et al., 2006) and there are theoretical reasons why it may reduce trafficking of lymphocytes in the lung and mucosa (Woodside and Vanderslice, 2008) .
4 Ribavirin and interferon are also mentioned in the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Plan; 2 in the present study, four patients in the mild group (7·27%) were administered ribavirin combined with antiviral therapy.
An additional example is shown for amodiaquine as a potential drug for COVID-19 in Figure 5 .Last, we show that EVIDENCEMINER is also useful for evidence finding for controversial topics.
Coronavirus and reproductive systemsCOVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) , which shares 76% amino acid sequence homology with SARS-COV and enters into target host cells by the same cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and cellular protease, transmembrane protease serine (TMPRSS) (Lukassen et al., 2020) .
In this context, other drugs also showed significant efficacy against SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, including remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir ( https://drugvirus.info/ ) [6] .Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic routinely used to treat bacterial infections, was found to be active in vitro against SARS-CoV and has joined the list of molecules that could be used in the therapeutic arsenal against COVID-19 [7] .

Other avian gammacoronaviruses, including guinea fowl and turkey coronavirus are dependent on long glycans (linear or branched) capped with either an alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid (GfCoV only) or galactose ending glycans (both TCoV and GfCoV) (25, 26).
To date, no pre-clinical studies have evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Interferon-α, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Arbidol were used according to previous experience, however, there's a lack of evidence of unified treatment plan.
There is currently no definitive cure for COVID-19, and the treatment regimens prescribed for patients are the main treatments that have previously been effective in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and chloroquine phosphate is the only medicine whose therapeutic effect has been proven by a clinical trial.
Since remdesivir or IL-6 receptor antagonist was not given in a systematic fashion in our study, we will have to wait for the results from the controlled trials to understand their effectiveness.
Chloroquine/HydroxychloroquineChloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have garnered significant interest as potential options for treating COVID-19.
Apart from supportive care, oxygen supply in mild cases, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and low-dose corticosteroids in critical cases, intravenous remdesivir and convalescent plasma might be the effective potential therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Immunotherapy with tocilizumab is listed as a treatment option for severe or critical cases of COVID-19 with elevated IL-6 in the 7th edition of the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guide [29].
Secondary structural prediction was calculated using the BeStSel analysis server 10 .To ensure that the CD spectral change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence of porcine mucosal heparin did not arise from the addition of the heparin alone, which is known to possess a CD spectrum at high concentrations 11,12 a difference spectrum was analysed.
Early results from clinical studies conducted in China suggest that chloroquine use might have been associated with reduced fever, increased resolution of lung lesions on CT, and delayed disease progression.
Based on our insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV and those responsible for SARS and MERS.
The results showed that 19% of the patients had el evated serum creatinine, 27% had elevated urea nitrogen, and 63% had urine protein (+ to ++).
In the meantime, a small controlled, non-randomized study of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine has been recently published [42] .
98 Although in preclinical development,EIDD-1931 is orally bioavailable, a significant advantage compared to remdesivir, and hasincreased potency against viruses containing mutations in RdRp that conferred increasedresistance to remdesivir, supporting the potential for a combination therapy to address therisk of SARS-CoV-2 becoming clinically drug resistant.
Initial reports showed that oseltamivir was given to 93% of patients (orally administered 75 mg 2x/day) in combination with antibiotics.
While in vitro data of SARS-CoV-2 provide compelling rationale for suggesting clinical efficacy of HCQ [4, 34] , in vivo data and randomized double blinded placebo COVID-19 studies of HCQ are needed to account of contextdependent effects of the host being administered HCQ.
She received Azithromycin (500 mg PO daily) and Oseltamivir (75 mg, PO BID) and Lianhua qingwen capsule (1.2 gm PO BID).
The 28-day mortality of heparin users was lower than that of non-users among patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy scores !4 (40.0% vs. 64.2%, P Z 0.029), or D-dimer > 6-fold the upper limit of normal (32.8% vs. 52.4%, P Z 0.017).
13 Regarding RAS activity, aging is associated with activation of RAS,14 and testosterone in males is thought to increase renin levels.
Educating our colleagues and citing evidence may be helpful, such as pointing to recent results from the PACIFIC trial demonstrating 3 year overall survival of 66% in patients with LA-NSCLC in patients treated with chemoradiotherapy and consolidation durvalumab.
Further, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be efficiently inhibited by two 43 synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and also by the broad range serine protease inhibitor 44 aprotinin.
Although some important considerations preclude a definite judgement on the possible efficacy of LPV/RTV (for example, some major limitations are the open-label nature of the trial and the fact that LPV/RTV was initiated late with respect to the onset of symptoms, see question 7), especially in the case of early initiation, the results of this RCT provide evidence currently discouraging the use of LPV/RTV (or of other protease inhibitors such as darunavir) in COVID-19 patients (also considering the potential side effects, see table 3), unless   favorable results from other ongoing RCT in specific subgroups of patients are available   (see table 2 ).
Interleukin-6 inhibitors (Tocilizumab) ::: Severe and critical illnessTocilizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin that blocks the IL-6 receptor.
The preliminary findings from CloroCovid-19 trial suggest that the higher dosage of CQ (12 g total dose over 10 days) in COVID-19 should not be recommended because of safety concerns regarding QTc prolongation and increased lethality, in the Brazilian population, and more often in older patients in use of drugs such as azithromycin and oseltamivir, which also prolong QTc interval.
In addition, the carbonyl group of baicalein is hydrogen bonded with the backbone amide group of E166.
Several antiviral therapies have been considered to be potentially effective in treating COVID-19, including oseltamivir, ganciclovir, arbidol and lopinavir / ritonavir.
Patients treated with this combination therapy were also found to have a decreased need for corticosteroids and reduced risk of nosocomial infection, when compared to patients given standard care (ribavirin only) (15) .
Patients with COPD taking inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combination therapy have an increased pneumonia risk, especially with lipophilic drugs such as fluticasone furoate, 11 due to its prolonged lung retention and associated local immunosuppression in the presence of altered lung microbiome and impaired mucociliary clearance.
In addition, arbidol, an anti-influenza drug targeting the viral hemagglutinin (HA) is being used in a clinical trial against COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000029573) and has been recently added to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (sixth and seventh editions) in China.
Remdesivir, a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug with activity against MERS-CoV in mouse models has been given to one COVID-19 patient in the USA on a compassionate basis without adverse events, and randomised controlled trials formally investigating its use in COVID-19 infection have already been registered.
All patients in that study received thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin.
Accordingly, on the basis of thisevidence, we proposed a rational design of novel protease inhibitor(s) derived fromlopinavir and ritonavir to enhance the binding efficiency with SARS-CoV-23CLpro as follows: (i) changing the phenyl ring in the P1 region to theγ-lactam ring to increase the extent of H-bond formation with residues F140, H163,and E166, (ii) introducing P3 polar moieties (e.g., pyridone ring) to form H-bonds withthe negatively charged E166, and (iii) adding the reactive α-ketoamide group locatedbetween positions P1 and P1′ to covalently bond with the catalytic residue C145, asdepicted in Figure 7.

The Ebola virus, like COVID-19, also induces a cytokine storm that is neutralised by the immunomodulatory action of ozone.
Supply shortage of hydroxychloroquine, which remains needed for standard indications such as Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis should be prevented by a significant effort of pharmaceutical companies, already ongoing, for increasing the production of hydroxychloroquine specifically for COVID-19.
Moreover, experiments with monkey cell line (Vero E6) showed that chloroquine interferes with the receptor glycosylation and thereby affects the entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.
Added value of this studyOur study is the first randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled clinical trial assessing the effect of intravenous remdesivir in adults admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19.
For objective testing of the preventive potential, persons at risks like therapeutic staff following direct unprotected contact with corona patients as well as relatives of patients who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and who are living in the same household should inhale HCQ in comparison to placebo during the incubation period of 5-7 days without symptoms.
In addition, calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine (53), in combination with antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicines, could also be evaluated for activity against SARS-CoV-2.
Moreover, hydroxychloroquine was more effective than chloroquine at impairing SARS-CoV-2 viral replication when given prophylactically; the 48-hour EC50 for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were 5.85µM and 18.01µM respectively [39].
Therefore, non-immunosuppressive derivatives of cyclosporine A might serve as broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable against emerging virus like 2019-nCoV, which still needs to be confirmed by clinical studies in the future.
For patients exhibiting progressive deterioration in oxygenation, rapid radiological progression, and high levels of cytokine storms, short-term administration of methylprednisolone at a dose of 40 mg every 12 h for a total of 5 days can be considered.

In the context of other neuromuscular diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin [27] .
[24] have not observed similar results in 11 COVID-19 patients who have received the combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
SARS-CoV-2 infection of ferrets and the human also appears to down-regulate synthesis of NAD from tryptophan and nicotinic acid (NA) while upregulating synthesis capacity from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR).
ibuprofen) could worsen COVID-19 symptoms, despite the fact that there is currently no scientific evidence to support this claim.
While malaria is endemic in poor parts of the world, the prevalence is still too less than the panic and feared caused by prevalence of COVID-19 prompting pharmaceuticals for scaling up for the production of chloroquine.
On the other hand, the HIV-1 protease inhibitors, tipranavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, indinavir, darunavir, atazanavir, and amprenavir are widely reported to be able to deactivate Mpro (Yang et al., 2003).

A French study that used hydroxychloroquine together with azithromycin reported a significant reduction in viral load in COVID-19 patients when used in combination 16 .
In this study, it was confirmed that the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities of chloroquine may account for its potent efficacy in treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
In particular, we see that a controversy has arisen in the use of repositioning treatments, such as chloroquine [2, 3] , for coronavirus, which justifies calling on those who have the most experience with this disease to communicate to the rest of the scientific world, in order to shed light on the choices to come.
53 Another study analyzed 15 critical cases and 424 suggested that a low dose and short duration of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone <1 mg/kg, 425 less than 7 days) may be beneficial for critically ill patients with COVID-19.
The suggested mechanism for remdesivir involves the host cells’ post-entry stage (23).

system, 48 which may serve as a partial mechanism for the purported beneficial effects of chloroquine therapy on COVID-19 outcomes.
It thus may be more likely that local rather than disseminated thrombin generation is at play in COVID-19 patients.
In previous studies we have identified admission D-dimer [1], prothrombin time (PT) [2], and thrombocytopenia [3] as prognostic markers of severe disease and/or mortality in COVID-19.
Methylprednisolone is another drug under investigation that is currently being used to treat severe cases of COVID-19 that are complicated by ARDS (49).
57 Thus, during the pandemic, the frequency of blood monitoring required for clozapine maintenance could be reduced.
Of 167 patients, 99.40% received initial antiviral therapy using lopinavir and ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg, bid) for no more than 10 days and/or atomized inhalation of interferon-α except for a 2-year-old patient, who was given interferon-α only, and 25.15% of patients received 40 mg methylprednisolone for 3 to 5 days.
Moreover, in vitro evidence indicates that TMPRSS2 inhibition by camostat mesylate may be beneficial to prevent the infection of SARS-CoV-2 15 .TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in both localized and metastatic prostate cancers 17, 18 and its transcription is regulated by the androgen receptor (AR) 17 .
Additionally, the rationale of testing such virus-directed plus host-directed drug combination is consistent with a novel study describing hypertension as a 175 potential risk factor observed among a cohort of inpatients with COVID-19 (19), and two reports not anticipating potential adverse effects of diltiazem (27) or negative pharmacological interactions of between remdesivir and diltiazem for the treatment of COVID-19 (28) .
11 It has beenshown that camostat mesylate, a clinically approved TMPRSS2 inhibitor,was able to block SARS-CoV-2 entry to human cells, indicating itspotential as a drug for COVID-19.11ACE2 involvement with coronavirus infection is of further interestsince ACE2 is a potent negative regulator restraining overactivationof the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that may be involved in elicitationof inflammatory lung disease in addition to its well-known role inregulation of blood pressure and balance of body fluid and electrolytes.

suggested that baricitinib may reduce both the viral entry and inflammation [134] .Lu reported that remdesivir may have the greatest potential for the successful treatment of SARS-CoV-2, but the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in COVID-19 needs further evaluation [135] .
These results indicate that the presence of several arginine residues at the S1/S2 site is required for efficient SARS-2-S proteolytic processing in human cells and also confers high cleavability to SARS-S.Furin Cleaves the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein at the S1/ S2 Site, and Cleavage Is Required for Efficient Cell-Cell Fusion We next investigated which protease is required for S protein processing at the S1/S2 site.
Notably, the first reported use of remdesivir, in the first diagnosed patient with 2019-nCoV infection in the USA,14 has encouraged additional clinical study of this medication.
While such assays still need to be carefully validated to be sure they could react only to antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
However, both drugs have been proven to be associated with elevated cholesterol levels 65, 66 .
It was reported that severe COVID-19 patients had elevated IL-6 levels, and there are case reports which describe good outcomes with tocilizumab [56].

Comparison between the in vitro inhibitory concentration of ivermectin 11 with exemplar published C max values of the drug 12, 17 In vitro end-points 11 Inhibitory concentrations (µmol/L) The repurposed antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine that have been included in numerous COVID-19 treatment protocols also have micromolar inhibitory concentrations against SARS-CoV-2 26 and nanomolar C max values 27 .
It is also noteworthy that the generated molecule with highest predicted pIC50 for RBD (and with docking binding free energy of -6.9 kcal/mol in the top binding mode with pocket 1) shares a strong maximum common subgraph similarity [Cao et al., 2008] with Telavancin, an approved Pneumonia drug, as shown in Figure 6 .
14 Interestingly the patient was treated with methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin added on antibiotics, and after three weeks the ventricular function as well as the myocardial injury markers had fully recovered to the normal range.
Title: "Remote monitoring of intranasal ketamine self-administration as maintenance therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD): a novel strategy for vulnerable and atrisk populations to COVID-19?"
Cuando esto ocurre, tenemos un índice de selectividad muy alto, es decir, el fármaco actúa selectivamente contra el virus sin dañar al organismo, como se vio que ocurría en el caso de la cloroquina y el remdesivir 8 .Ya que la cloroquina actúa impidiendo la entrada del virus a las células, se ensayaron tres pautas de tratamiento que verificaron el potencial inhibitorio de la cloroquina antes y después de producirse la infección de las células vero, al tiempo que el remdesivir resultó únicamente efectivo con la infección ya establecida 8 .El que la concentración con que la cloroquina lograba inhibir al 90% del patógeno, de 6.90 μM, hubiera sido previamente alcanzada en pacientes con AR a dosis de 500mg 8 , motivó el comienzo de varios ensayos clínicos en china, cuyos resultados preliminares se publicaban el día 19 de febrero en un artículo de revisión que afirmaba que este fármaco había demostrado beneficios en 100 pacientes, logrando presumiblemente impedir la exacerbación de la neumonía, mejorar las imágenes pulmonares de la tomografía computarizada (TC), promover la negativización del virus y acortar la duración de la enfermedad sin producirse ninguna reacción adversa severa 9 .Ante esta evidencia, en el propio artículo se aconsejaba el uso de la cloroquina fosfato en pacientes con COVID-19 9 , recomendación que se añade ese mismo día al Plan Nacional Chino de Diagnóstico y Tratamiento, en su versión número 6, donde aparece como tratamiento antiviral de primera línea, en una dosis de 500 mg vía oral 2 veces al día durante 7 días 10 .El 9 de marzo se publicó el segundo ensayo in vitro de la cloroquina, que esta vez comparaba este fármaco con otro del mismo grupo, la hidroxicloroquina, que difiere en su estructura molecular al incorporar un grupo hidroxilo, que le confiere una serie de propiedades particulares, como un mayor efecto inmunomodulador, posiblemente relacionado con su acción sobre los receptores de tipo toll (TLRs) y la disminución de la producción de IL-6, cuyo papel en estos enfermos cobra importancia en la génesis del SAM 4 ; así como un mejor perfil de seguridad que permite emplear dosis mayores, y menos interacciones 4,11,12 , que la hacen especialmente atractiva en los pacientes mayores y con comorbilidades, a menudo polimedicados, que son los afectados con mayor gravedad por el virus.
A recent study has revealed that arbidol can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection at a concentration of 10-30 µM effectively in vitro[30].
Teicoplanin, ritavancin, dalbavancin and monensin are approved antibiotics, whereas emetine is an anti-protozoal drug.
Based on the first reported genome sequence of 2019-nCoV (4), we expressed ectodomain residues 1 to 1208 of 2019-nCoV S,adding two stabilizing proline mutations in the C-terminal S2 fusion machinery using aprevious stabilization strategy that proved effective for other betacoronavirus S proteins(11, 14).
Por ahora, el tratamiento es únicamente de apoyo y depende del estado clínico del paciente 36 .Los antivirales de amplio espectro, como el remdesivir, el lopinavir/ritonavir y el interferón beta, han demostrado ser prometedores contra el MERS-CoV en modelos animales y se está evaluando su actividad contra el actual 2019-nCoV 36 .
Type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) inhibitors ::: TreatmentSARS-CoV-2 uses the cellular protease TMPRSS2 receptor, SARS-CoV receptor and ACE-2 for entry into target cells as mentioned by Hoffmann et al.
Where Italy and later Spain are criticized by not being quick enough to react on the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, one wonders whether others would have made different decisions at that time.
• Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered, ß-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavirus titers were observed.
Like all RNA-based viruses, the new coronavirus tends to mutate faster than DNA-viruses, but lower than influenza viruses Currently, there is not a vaccine, neither efficient treatment, although many drugs (chloroquine, for instance) are under clinical trial.
Whether the same applies to drugs that block the mineralocorticoid receptor and antagonize aldosterone, another downstream mediator in the ACE-1–Ang II–AT1R pathway, remains unknown.
Taking into account the antiviral in vitro effect, CQ has been considered to be a valuable candidate, alone or in combination with lopinavir, for further testing in animal models or direct off-label use for coronavirus-related diseases [2].
This study also accenture in the development of new therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 based on Arbidol using structure-guided drug designing.
Heat-inactivated samples were 2-fold serially diluted in DMEM medium supplemented with NaHCO3, HEPES buffer, penicillin, streptomycin, and 1% fetal bovine serum, starting at a dilution of 1:10 in 50 μL.
It includes elevated fibrinogen and D-dimers, minimal changes in PT, PTT and platelet count in early stages of infection, no antithrombin deficiency, coagulopathy being related to severity of illness, overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC; ISTH criteria) being an end-stage evolution in the most severe cases, mainly in non-survivors.
2.2.5.3Papain-like protease SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLPro) is a cysteine cleavage protein located within the non-structural protein 3 (NS3) section of the viral genome [20] .
D-dimer is the fibrin degradation products released upon cleavage of crosslinked fibrin by plasmin 29 .
Altogether, our results suggest that these three NTP analogues are more prone to be excised than remdesivir, implicating that they are not effective to inhibit RNA replication of SARS-CoV-2.To consolidate the above-mentioned simulation results, we performed in vitro experiments in Vero E6 cells and show that NTP analogues favipiravir, vidarabine and fludarabine indeed fail to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig.
In addition to leukopenia (reported in 9%-25% of cases) or leukocytosis (24%-30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37%  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58 of cases.
Specifically, the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission were higher in ECMO treated patients (median AST 38.
Timely adjustment management and treatment strategy prior to guideline update: The first evidence of digestive tract involvement in COVID-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out in our hospital.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant (in bold).Abbreviations: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 19; PA (positive on admission); PP (persistently positive); NLR: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; PLTs, platelets; Hb, hemoglobin; ALB, albumin; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CRP, C-reactive protein; SAA, serum amyloid A.
Treatment included ceftazidime 4 g daily, paracetamol, and 1 L of intravenous saline daily.
The authors report on 236 patients (140 [59%] men and 96 [41%] women; median age 65 years [IQR 56-71]), with inconclusive findings on the primary outcome of time to clinical improvement, defined as a two-point improvement on a 6-point ordinal scale, 2 a hazard ratio of 1·23 (95% CI 0·87-1·75; favouring remdesivir), and median observation times of 21 days (IQR 13-28) in the remdesivir group versus 23 days (15-28) in the placebo group (a non-significant difference).The study was well designed-a double-blind, placebocontrolled, multicentre, randomised trial-and well conducted, with high protocol adherence and no loss to follow up.
Primary outcomeThe antiviral efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the treatment of 73 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were shown in Table 2 .
It thus seems likely that the rapid control of the pulmonary hyperinflammation resulted from tocilizumab treatment.
Outcomes from the In silico molecular docking study maintained the great inhibitory efficacy of the one anti-H1N1 drug (Oseltamivir), one anti-TB drug (Rifampin), four anti-HIV drugs (Maraviroc, Etravirine, Indinavir, Rilpivirine) and seven anti-malarial drugs (Atovaquone, Quinidine, Halofantrine, Amodiaquine, Tetracylcine, Azithromycin, hydroxycholoroquine) since they could launch H2 bonds with different amino acid residues that caused in an inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 protease activity with higher binding affinity ranging from (-10.67 to -8.3 kcal/mol).
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) at prophylactic doses are associated with a reduced 28-day mortality in more severe COVID-19 patients [9], displaying a sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score ≥ 4 (40.0% vs. 64.2%, P = 0.029) or D-dimer levels more than six-fold the upper limit of normal (32.8% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.017).
Confinement may lead to a new form of society and economy, to a new way of leaving in the near future.• Different analysis of the propagation of COVID-19 appear-2 Drugs based on chloroquine proposed by Pr.
Other routine blood tests, including coagulation tests, blood biochemistry and infection-related biomarkers did not significantly differ except for thrombin time (p=0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.008).
For example, bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and is under investigational use for COVID-19, is associated with increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including MI, cerebrovascular accidents, and VTE (40,41).
29, 30 In vitro studies have demonstrated that remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in non-human cells.
The results showed that the experimental group (treated with favipilavir, 120 cases) is significantly better than the control group (treated with arbidol, 120 cases) in the treatment of COVID-19.
The trypsin-like serine protease hepsin which has a fairly broad action and which is significantly inhibited by a diverse set of ligands, a particular example of one such binding is represented by protein data bank entry 5ce1.
16 Interestingly, ciclesonide and mometasone, but not budesonide, beclomethasone, or fluticasone, exhibit in vitro suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication to a similar degree as lopinavir, albeit in preliminary non peer reviewed data.
pDNA was transformed into E. coli (New England BioLabs, UK), cultured in 100 mL of Luria Broth (LB) with 100 μ g/mL carbenicillin (Sigma Aldrich, UK).
22 In a mouse model investigating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, prophylactic and early therapeutic postexposure administration of remdesivir were shown to produce a significant reduction in pulmonary viral load (i.e., >2 orders of magnitude on day 2e5 post-infection), mitigate disease progression and prominently improve respiration function.
As respiratory and cardiovascular diseases represent potential risk factors for increased COVID-19 mortality, our results are in line with the hypothesis that long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide is linked with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.
Besides, azithromycin −suggested to act in combination with C/HC against SArs-CoV-2 [6]− is also known for inducing QT interval prolongation.
This has led to the initiation of several clinical trials and the off-label use of tocilizumab in symptomatic COVID-19 patients.
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has emerged as a controversial and potential candidate therapy for COVID-19 [4, 5] ; however, the mechanisms of HCQ antiviral action are unclear.
7 Interaction between HCQ and a QT-prolonging agent or a QT-shortening agent (digoxin) also increases the risk of arrhythmias.
Taken together, these results suggested that arbidol impeded not only viral attachment, but also release of SARS-CoV-2 from intracellular vesicles (ELs).
But the patients with severe pneumonia had elevations in leukocytes, neutrophils, and creatinine kinase.
There are 10 ongoing registered clinical trials in China, Korea, Thailand, and Hong Kong evaluating LPV/r as monotherapy or in combination with other antivirals (eg, ribavirin, interferon beta-1b) or traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of COVID-19.Real-world data for treatment of COVID-19 with LPV/r are emerging.
Chlorine disinfection (liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sodium hypochlorite), which has long been used in hospital wastewater disinfection in China, is adopted in this scheme.
It has been conjectured the loss of function of exonuclease may be involved with the three additional nucleotides added after the incorporation of remdesivir into the extended strand [22] .In vitro and animal models, remdesivir has demonstrated activity against both SARS and MERS that also belong to coronaviruses, and theoretically provides support its effectiveness in treating COVID-19.
Although we mainly conducted in vitro assays to experimentally validate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of olaparib and CVL218 due to limited time, it is natural to speculate that other PARP1 inhibitors may also have antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on our computational prediction and experimental validation results.
During the initial outbreak in China, the use of tocilizumab to stop severe CRS-associated organ failure and death in COVID-19 patients was attempted.
24,25 A U.S. study showed that remdesivir had good therapeutic effect.
Elective switching to injectable therapies is not recommended, and a prior trial exploring this in patients receiving infliximab who were switched to adalimumab was associated with relapses.
COVID-19–infected patients harbor an expanded population of circulating monocytes that secrete both IL-6 and IL-1β (Wen et al., 2020Preprint; Zhang et al., 2020Preprint); as a result, patients with COVID-19 have elevated levels of serum IL-6, as well as lactate dehydrogenase levels, compared with healthy controls (Chen et al., 2020a).
For example the development of serine protease inhibitor or RBD-based vaccine also became coronavirus therapy approach.
azathioprine, methotrexate] for inducing and maintaining remission as well as for preventing IBD-associated complications.
has been mentioned in the title of their publication as follows: "Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro".
1Many clinical trials are currently investigating potential medications to treat COVID-19 including remdesivir (a prodrug in development), immunoglobulins, arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomization, ASC09F plus oseltamivir, ritonavir plus oseltamivir, lopinavir plus ritonavir and some other drug (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=2019nCoV&term=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=), but no specific treatment or vaccine is approved yet.
Evaluation of the hypothesis and discussionFinasteride and less selective dutasteride both block 5-alpha-reductase isoform 3, which is expressed in respiratory epithelium and fibroblasts (5) .
After Nickel column chromatography followed by ulp1 protease digestion for tag removal, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD proteins were further purified via size-exclusion chromatography (with the buffer consisting of 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L sodium chloride, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol), and then concentrated by ultrafiltration to a final concentration of 22 mg/mL.
Preliminary clinical evidence from an observational 324 registry-based study found that COVID-19 patients that were ventilated and received single-325 dose ivermectin (150 µg/kg) had a significantly lower mortality rate, duration of hospitalization, 326 and duration in the intensive care unit (32).
For example, remdesivir is an approved HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which has broad-spectrum activities against RNA viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but showed less effective in a Ebola clinical trial [4] [5] [6] .
A couple of reports recently showed that SARS-CoV-2 also enters through this mechanism, and thus the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells may be blocked by using inhibitors of TMPRSS2, such as camostat mesylate (Fig.
Therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 InfectionsClinical trials with the nucleotide analog remdesivir (Clinical-Trials.gov: NCT04257656, NCT04252664, NCT04280705, etc.)
Regarding the sites under positive selective pressure found on the spike glycoprotein, the results have shown that the 536th aminoacidic position in 2019‐nCoV has an asparagine residue, whereas the bat SARS‐like coronavirus has a glutamine residue.
Recommendation 17: For severe COVID-19 patients with coagulation dysfunction, the infusion dose of crystalloids and synthetic colloid should be controlled while maintaining adequate tissue perfusion ::: PreventionPrevious studies have shown that Sonoclot was used to detect the coagulation status of healthy people after an input of 1 L of normal saline or succinyl gelatin.
6 Though anti-viral molecules and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation to avert severe disease, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] currently, there are no specific therapies for COVID-19, particularly when severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs.
The health system cannot sustain a massive influx of infectious cases into emergency units and hospitals.
Furthermore, there is the potential for combining baricitinib with the direct-acting antivirals (lopinavir or ritonavir and remdesivir) currently being used in the COVID-19 outbreak, since it has a minimal interaction with the relevant CYP drug-metabolising enzymes.
Moreover, moieties of basic amino acid residues, known to constitute heparin binding domains, are solvent accessible on the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD surface and form a continuous patch that is suitable for heparin binding.
Given that chloroquine is also an anti-malaria drug, and that CID 76332092 shows a predicted pIC50 of 7.82 and lowest docking binding free energy of -6.80 kcal/mol (Figure 9 ) to the ACE-2 binding pocket of RBD (Table 4) , this molecule deserves further investigation in the context of SARS-CoV-2.
DiscussionWe present the first case of TdP in a COVID-19 patient treated with chloroquine.
However, there are always rare exceptions to the rule; for example, a single case report of fulminant hepatitis associated with an unusual echovirus-25 infection in a patient on ocrelizumab therapy (Nicolini et al., 2019; Novi G, Mikulska M, Briano F, Toscanini F, Tazza F, Uccelli A, Inglese M, 2020) .In light of this case report and the other supportive data, the MS community may now reconsider its advice about not giving MS DMTs during the COVID-19 pandemic (Alasdair Coles and the MS Advisory Group, 2020).
The serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, approved in Japan to treat unrelated diseases, has been shown to block TMPRSS2 activity 54, 55 and is thus another interesting candidate.
Recently, human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to carry out the priming of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by generating two distinct fragments of the viral spike protein, S1/S2 and S2' (Hoffman et al.,2020).
Azithromycin when added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination (36) .
Top-ranking drugs included Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib, which are currently being assessed in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 ( Figure S5 ).
Furthermore, given that the patch can be KEY TEACHING POINTSWith a finite number of telemetry beds, novel ways to monitor cardiac arrhythmias on non-telemetry floors are needed as the number of COVID-19 patients being treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and chloroquine continues to rise.
All patients in Marseille center were proposed oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg, three times per day during ten days (in this preliminary phase ,we did not enrolled children in the treatment group based in data indicating that children develop mild symptoms of COVID-19 [4] ).
Research published April 18 th , 2020 found that patients exposed to highest amount of environmental nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) had increased risk of death from COVID-19, and that long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality by compounding lung inflammation [20] .
Remdesivir is already administered for COVID-19 through compassionate use requests, and clinical trials for its use against COVID-19 have already started in the U.S.(clinical trial ID NCT04280705) and China.
Type of interventions -Immunosuppressants (e. g. methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate; cyclophosphamide); -Immunomodulators (e.g glucocorticoids; immunoglobulins); -Immunobiologics (e.g tocilizumab, infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, certulizumab, rituximab, secukinumab, ustekinumab); -DMARDs (e.g chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine); -Targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (e.g.
However, a large prospective, placebo-controlled study which was evaluating its use in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients was stopped early because of a higher rate of relapse of hematological malignancies in the azithromycin arm [5] .From the perspective of antiviral immunity, a robust immune response requires both a healthy immune system and adequate duration of exposure to the virus.
Five RCTs are currently under way to test the efficacy of colchicine in COVID-19 patients (NCT04322682, NCT04322565, NCT04328480, NCT04326790, NCT04350320).
We conducted homology modeling to build all possible protein structures, including viral papain like protease (PLpro), main protease (3CLpro, also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, Spike, etc.
Based on these results, further research of nelfinavir's effect in human COVID-19 patients is warranted.
So that drugs like camostat mesylate is not recommended compared to ACE2 specific inhibitors due to the side effect caused by TMPRSS2 in uninfected cells.
Moreover, chloroquine and remdesivir were shown to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.
30 While a recent trial using hydroxychloroquine was more promising and showed that treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients,31 this study included only a small number of individuals and therefore considered to have very limited validity.
There has been some interesting research into potential medical therapies to treat patients with COVID-19; in particular there has been attention to a therapy that is used primarily for rheumatoid arthritis, the interleukin-6 blocker tocilizumab.
One mL SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD (800 nM) was mixed with the appropriate low molecular weight heparin at the indicated concentration and injected over the biotinylated heparin sensing surface at 500 µl.min -1 .
The most common adverse effects reported were gastrointestinal in nature, as well as elevation in transaminases and infusion site reactions ( Table 2) .Several Phase III trials are underway to determine the efficacy of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 (2) .
Reassuringly, five patients on natalizumab infected with dengue virus cleared the virus without complications similar to those on fingolimod (Fragoso et al., 2016b) .Clearly, any decision to start a DMT during the COVID-19 pandemic will need to be taken carefully and will depend on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic, not only in the particular country concerned, but in the specific area the patient lives and receives therapy.
The data from SARS-CoV-1 are encouraging, but this must be weighed against the inferior performance in mouse models against MERS-CoV, the less potent in vitro activity compared with remdesivir and chloroquine for SARS-CoV-1, and limited data suggesting no advantage over standard care for SARS-CoV-2.
The discrepancies in findings may stem from different patient populations, differences in inclusion criteria, paucity of long-term follow-up data, differences in drug dosages, lack of control group and inclusion of azithromycin in the some studies.
HCQ is threefold more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, resulting in the clinical recommendation to treat orally with 800 mg at the first day and at 400 mg on the following four days (27) .Two major points of action are postulated for CQ/HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19:(1) they perturb the terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 protein and inhibit cell-binding Why the oral application form might have disadvantagesFrom a pharmacological standpoint, one major problem of oral treatment with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine is that relatively high concentrations between 1-10 µM are needed to inhibit the glycosylation of the soluble ACE2 receptor at the alveolar surface in the lung.
Some COVID-19 patients are responding well to chloroquine whereas others are not.
The efficacy of arbidol against coronavirus is not, however, well substantiated scientifically or clinically.
remdesivir which shows potential to treat 2019-nCoV infections (7, 8) .
239 On the basis of the structure of EK1C, series of cholesteryl EK1 with multiple 240 linkers were constructed, where the glycine/serine-based linker, i.e., GSG, or 241 PEG-based spacer was employed between EK1 and the cholesterol moiety (Fig.
Patients were excluded if they had a known allergy to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine or had another known contraindication to treatment with the study drug, including retinopathy, G6PD deficiency and QT prolongation.
Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog that has been reported to have activity against MERS-CoV, a coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 (21) .
[3] [4] [5] [6] It is also suggested in vitro that HCQ can prevent glycosylation of virus cell proteins including the ACE2 receptor, inhibiting virus entry and replication, and that similar compounds like chloroquine can specifically inhibit SARS-Cov-2.
Laboratory findings on admission showed that more patients with high risk of venous thromboembolism had abnormal concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein than did patients with low risk after adjustment for age (appendix).In patients with pneumonia caused by pneumococcal or influenza infection, the occurrence of venous thromboembolism has been shown to be increased.
Hispidin forms a strong hydrogen bond network with nCoV-2019 protease, six hydrogen bonds have been observed in both blind and specific docking.
In patients with mild-moderate COVID-19, 7 day’s clinical recovery rate was 55.86% in the arbidol group and 71.43% in the favipiravir group (P = 0.0199).
In conclusion, chloroquine and hydroxchloroquine might have therapeutic potential for the medication of COVID-19 in the current context of pandemic situation.
Anti-viral (Arbidol) and antibiotics (moxifloxacin) was administrated together with other supportive treatment.
The efficacy of therapeutic remdesivir treatment was tested in two groups of six adult rhesus macaques (3 males and 3 females each; 3.
Most patients (96.3%) in our study received antiviral therapy, including lopinavir/ritonavir (64.9%), interferon alpha inhalation (50.7%), arbidol (42.5%), ribaviron (32.8%) and chloroquine (2%).Up to now, no specific treatment has been recommended for COVID-19 infection except for optimal supportive care.
In addition, several biomarkers such as decreased albumin levels as well as elevated creatine kinase levels and higher LDH levels were associated with poor outcome of COVID-19 [6] .
24 However, 149 both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolised by CYP3A4, and COVID-19 150 treatment with (hydroxy)chloroquine can be combined with additional anti-viral treatments 9 such as ritonavir plus lopinavir (both potent CYP3A4 inhibiting drugs; their combination is 152 associated with QT-prolongation), azithromycin (besides a macrolide antibiotic also 153 investigated for its antiviral properties, with also (weak) CYP3A4 inhibition and associated 154 with QT-prolongation) 25,26 , or remdesivir (an investigational drug for which metabolism and 155 possible QT prolonging effects are not yet resolved).
The Gilead’s NUC inhibitor, remdesivir, having a similar chemical structure to HIV reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, is currently being tested in clinical trials for 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2), while a drug targeting the spike glycoprotein has also been tested in phase I trials for the treatment of HIV and SARS-CoV.4CRISPR/Cas13d is an RNA-guided, RNA-targeting CRISPR system.
Although based on low-level evidence and pending RCT results, in our opinion early hydroxychloroquine administration should be considered in COVID-19 patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms, whereas further data is needed to better delineate the true balance between possible favorable effects and toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
27 Experts in China have suggested the use of chloroquine for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 but no clinical data has been provided yet to support this announcement.
[2671314] The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry has 506 studies registered on COVID-19, and out of these, 17 are on chloroquine and 7 are on hydroxychloroquine.
These results are of great importance because a recent paper has shown that the mean duration of viral shedding in patients suffering from COVID-in China was 20 days (even 37 days for the longest duration) [19]Very recently, a Chinese team published results of a study demonstrating that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72%µM) found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47%µM) [14] .
Note that a hydrogen bond worth about -4 kcal/mole is nonetheless effectively zero when binding well, because it is relative to binding to water.
Thalidomide will be used in two trials against COVID-19 (49, 50).

4 Translating the known aboutthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it hasbeen shown that full interaction of the virus with the ACE2 receptoris enabled once the viral spike protein is cleaved by surface proteases,namely, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2),5 although some findings argue against the strict necessityof the step.
DISCUSSIONThis population-based meta-analysis provided evidence that the incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection is low, only about 3.8%.However, the appearance AKI during COVID-19 infection should be recognized a strong warning signal: the in-hospital mortality with AKI in COVID-19 infected patients is greater, reach up to 32.6%; the death risk with AKI in COVID-19 infected patients is extremely high, about 16.1 times higher than those without AKI.The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), would be activated and cleaved by cellular transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSSs), leading to release of fusion peptides and fuse to host cells membrane.
The starting therapeutic scheme could include remdesivir, with the disadvantage of its intravenous administration, and HIV-1 protease inhibitors such as Lopinavir or Saquinavir.

Most notably, ten clinical trials at more than 50 global sites are underway to investigate remdesivir (GS-5734), an investigational antiviral originally developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus infection 22 .
As this paper is purely computational, it is clearly mentioned in the abstract and the conclusion that "The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp".
This docking result implies lopinavir and ritonavir tablets may not be suitable for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
[27] Another study claimed that remdesivir had a good therapeutic effect on COVID-19.
(50) , and will also be evaluated in the SOLIDARITY trial (38) .A number of additional immunomodulatory agents are also currently being evaluated, including the IL-6 inhibitor, Tocilizumab, and glucocorticosteroids (Tables 4 and 5) , given the cytokine storm syndrome which has been observed in subgroups with severe COVID-19 (51) with increased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, and additional inflammatory cytokines (52) .

Therefore, it is reasonable to delay rituximab infusions during the CoVID-19 outbreak.
We incorporated glutamine at the P1 position, because the available crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro revealed that only glutamine (and, at a very small number of cleavage sites, histidine) residue can occupy the S1 pocket of this enzyme.
A particular role in exacerbating the Covid-19 infection seems to have been assigned to Ibuprofen [6].
Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 virus poses, our long if not partially forgotten history with emetine and dehydroemetine, and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm that the COVID-19 virus is sensitive to these agents.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including ibuprofen have been widely used to treat fever or pain.
On a similar note, there is some suggestion that ibuprofen may increase expression of ACE-2 receptor, potentially increasing binding of the virus to target cells and potentiating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
DiscussionOwing to the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is great interest in using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin to improve the virucidal efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.
Whether this is the case, the TMPRSS2 inhibitor, camostat mesylate, which has been approved for some forms of cancer and hepatitis, might be a valuable treatment option for blocking multiple SARS-CoV-2 entry routes [21].

If misleading or incorrect information was transmitted to the public, the people may get anxious and react to the information in many ways, including making a panic purchase and trying unnecessary or even detrimental medicine regimens.
Other biomarkers that have been reported include increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates; elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine kinase levels; leukopenia; leukocytosis; and increased bilirubin and creatinine levels (57–59).
Thus, the slow T cell response may promote a limit inflammation 169 levels [42] , which might be a reason to the observations during COVID-19 pandemic of the detrimental 170 outcome on French patients that used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NADs) such as ibuprofen.
Since SARS-CoV-2 has shown analogous mechanisms to SARS, existing antiviral drugs used in the past epidemies -such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir-ritonavir -were primarily proposed.
The state of this switch can be controlled by tyrosine kinase activity involving the Src/Abl and other tyrosine kinases known to be upregulated during endosomal processes (Reinecke and Caplan, 2014 ) and viral infection (Davey et al., 2011) including in coronaviruses (Coleman et al., 2016; Dong et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2018; Sisk et al., 2018) .
In conclusion, we found that lopinavir-ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol treatment did not significantly increase cure rate, reduce hospitalization time, raise virus negative rate, and diminish virus negative time in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unknown, therefore the clinical effects of administration of antimalarials in COVID-19 patients is largely unpredictable [ 14 ] .Theory aside, the use of antimalarials attracted attention after a news briefing by the Chinese government in February 2020 revealed that, according to several Chinese studies, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine seemed 'to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19' [15] .
Remdesivir has been shown to have a diminishing effect on the pathological features of acute lung injury (ALI), a common clinical feature observed in COVID-19 patients.
Accordingly, the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 should be under clinical trials or treatment registries, and their off-label use outside of these trials is not currently recommended.
Unfortunately, no vaccines or drugs have been approved for clinical use, in spite of some already being in clinical trials 2, 3 , such as Chloroquine and Remdesivir 4, 5 .
The gustatory system (transmitted via the glossopharyngeal, facial and vagal nerve) only recognizes the basic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami (glutamate)), but most of the culinary experiences are recognized by the olfactory nerve.
After that, he was treated with chloroquine and azithromycin, oxygen for hypoxia, and intravenous fluid for correction of low BP.
However, the G. stearothermophilus spores in the BIs used in this study are known to be resistant to killing by hydrogen peroxide, and generally spores are substantially more resistant to sterilization than enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 30 .

acetaminophen), pointing in any case out that, in this period, other NSAIDs and paracetamol could also mask the pyrexial signs of COVID-19, resulting in a delayed diagnosis of the infection.
54 Therefore, ACE2 activities seems to be reduced in patients who succumb from ARDS.Further downstream, high levels of Ang II, which may be due to attenuated ACE2, such as that potentially caused by the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2, stimulates increased production of aldosterone.
In a previous work, it was shown that ozone water (4.86 mg/L) can completely inactivate SARS within 4 minutes (Zhang et al., 2004) .
For example, in the above putative 2019-nCoV S protein there are 20 occurrences of N (asparagine) followed by a residue that is not P (proline) which is followed in turn by S (serine) or T (threonine) at which glycosylation is likely to occur, followed by a residue that is not P (proline).
To combat this deadly COVID-19, a number of conventional drugs 8-10 like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, etc.

Host-Targeted Strategies ::: Treatment of Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 InfectionSeveral immune modulator drugs such as chloroquine, nitazoxanide, and ribavirin in combination of PEGylated interferon alfa-2a and -2b have shown inhibitory action against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Li and De Clercq 2020).
Promising in vitro data 3, 4 as well as anecdotal in vivo evidence of therapeutic benefit 5 have led many institutions, including Mayo Clinic, to consider the use of hydroxychloroquine as a first-line COVID-19 pharmacotherapy for the time being and spurred an array of clinical trials designed to assess the efficacy of repurposed hydroxychloroquine in both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.Although the collective safety profiles of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are relatively favorable, both drugs block the KCNH2-encoded HERG/K v 11.1 potassium channel and potentially can prolong the QTc.
By inspecting the 20 highest ranked drug candidates offered by the AI-Net pipeline (Table S4), we observe that several drugs in COVID-19 clinical studies (e.g., chloroquine, ritonavir).

Clinical laboratory investigation included whole blood count, serum biochemical test (including liver and renal function, lactate dehydrogenase, electrolytes and creatine kinase), coagulation test, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin.
Although detection of viral nucleic acid using real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the gold standard of diagnosis and monitoring, it is very time-consuming and has a high prevalence of false-negative results 6, 7 .Other laboratory tests, such as whole white blood cells (WBCs) count, neutrophil ratio, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hemoglobin, platelets, procalcitonin, creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, creatinine, cardiac troponin I, D-dimer, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and several other laboratory tests have been reported to change in COVID-19 patients 1, [8] [9] [10] .
Reduced liquid capital for new installations, disrupted supply chains in the Chinese manufacturing sector—which provides the majority of silicon used in photovoltaics—and lessened global energy demand may stunt the seemingly irreversible momentum of renewables.
Other antivirals identified herein with very limited potency against SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect were Lopinavir and Tipranavir, although it is worth mentioning that the inhibiting 20 ߤ M concentration identified is reachable in human plasma (Walmsley et al., 2008) .
ganciclovir.
Whether these data reflect a true requirement for a longer structure for SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding or instead, reflect a selective reduction in the presence of particular binding structures in the polysaccharide as a consequence of the processes (β-elimination for enoxaparin and partial enzymatic heparin degradation for oligosaccharides), remains to be determined.
Additionally, open approach should be avoided in order to reduce length of hospital stay and potential postoperative morbidity, thus reducing inhospital spread of nosocomial infections and Covid-19 ) [1, 5, 9] .In a recent systematic review analyzing current clinical studies in Primary CNS Lymphoma and in a Level III, single center, retrospective, nonrandomized observational study, the authors found that life expectancy and patient-reported outcomes were found to be superior at 3-year follow-up when using GKRS combined with methotrexate (MTX) compared with MTX only [7] .
75 Therefore, the non‐immunosuppressive derivatives of cyclosporine A might serve as broad‐range coronavirus inhibitors applicable against the emerging novel virus‐like COVID‐19.
Previous research had shown that 344 hydroxychloroquine and ammonium chloride interfere with SARS-CoV and SARS-345CoV-2 replication, as lysosomotropic agents that increase the pH in lysosomes [Talbot 346 and inhibited both viruses in similar concentrations, and SARS-CoV was more sensitive to 358 remdesivir than to SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 4A ).
Subsequent tolerance to sedatives (eg, dexmedetomidine) from their use early in the course of illness and high doses will also limit the effectiveness of these drugs during ventilator weaning.
There is also interest in the anti-IL-6 drug, tocilizumab (used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis), with seven registered trials.

It has been postulated that residues 31, 41, 82, 353, 355, and 357 of the ACE2 receptor map to the surface of the protein interacting with 2019-nCov spike protein (12), as previously documented for SARS-CoV.Following interaction, cleavage of the C-terminal segment of ACE2 by proteases, such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), enhances the spike protein-driven viral entry (13,14).
In this study, the drugs used by patients before admission are mainly antibacterial drugs (including moxifloxacin, cephalosporins), antiviral drugs (abidol, oseltamivir, acyclovir), and antipyretic drugs with acetaminophen.
Pre-print servers yielded four clinical studies which included a follow up study, a retrospective safety study, and a rapid review of chloroquine and HCQ in COVID-19 patients.
A 64-year-old Japanese man consulted a local physician for fever lasting 3 days and was initially treated with azithromycin with a presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia.
ConclusionUntil data from randomized controlled trials are available, we suggest caution utilizing hydroxychloroquine off label for patients with COVID-19.
A clinical double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (NCT04303507) will be initiated in may 2020 to evaluate the potential prevention of COVID-19 by chloroquine at a loading dose of 10 mg base / kg, followed by 150 mg of chloroquine base (250 mg chloroquine phosphate salt) daily for 3 months in 10 000 healthcare workers or other individuals at significant risk.

The second case shows a classic clinical form of COVID-19 presenting as hypoxemic pneumonia, in a patient with previous pulmonary comorbidity and treated with natalizumab, an anti-alpha4 integrin antibody, known to be at risk for JC virus infection.
Noteworthy, BCG vaccination which is currently being considered for clinical trials to test its potential against COVID-19, was previously shown when given once a month for 3 consecutive months to produce a significant reduction on the prevalence of adult upper respiratory tract infections in the elderly, at least partially through its induced significant increase of IFN-γ level as compared to the placebo group 11 .
The coronavirus can persist on inanimate surfaces at typical room temperatures and humidity for up to 9 days but inactivated efficiently by surface disinfection procedures with 62%-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.
Some in vitro and in silico studies have reported a virustatic effect of chloroquine and HCQ and estimated the therapeutic blood level from EC50, ranging from 0.3 to 2.1 mg/L [1, 5] .
At the time of designing this study, it was said that NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can increase the risk of complications when used during viral infections (including the coronavirus infection).
1,2The quinine analogue, CQ received little attention initially due to toxicity in humans.
64 Previous studies demonstrated that unfractionated heparin prevented SARSassociated coronavirus and other coronavirus strains from invading mammalian cells.
Amongst others, pioglitazone and liraglutide have also been shown to be associated with ACE2 upregulation in animal studies [14, 15] .
A coronavirus research at the university of Iowa suggested that Remdesivir antiviral acting much more potential if patient takes it early, patients with mild symptoms (Kai Kupferschmidt & Cohen, 2020).
In fact, ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril and captopril have been shown to have no effect on activity of ACE2 [30, 31] .
After chest CT scan and SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR testing, one of these three patients was confirmed to she did not take imatinib regularly due to side effects and the efficacy evaluation was failure.

ABSTRACT 6Background: Combinations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin have been 7 promoted as treatments for COVID-19 based on small, uncontrolled clinical trials that have not 8 assessed potential risks.
This means the only options currently available to pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease are limited to compassionate use of remdesivir, or off-label use of hydroxychloroquine or other therapies.
This measure is stable over time and the strategy of using the year 2018, before the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, is to include the health effects of exposures to pollutants, such as airborne particulate matter and ozone .
3, 4, 8 Based on this in vitro data, it has been hypothesized that hydroxychloroquine, more so than chloroquine, may have therapeutic efficacy in the COVID-19 pandemic by (1) preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2emediated viral entry (ie, preinfection prophylaxis) and (2) attenuating the postviral cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 cases via a multitude of immunomodulatory mechanisms (ie, treatment of active infection/postviral sequelae).
A clinical study of arbidol using for post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 in a high-risk population, including medical staff, is in progress (ChiCTR2000029592), may providing us whether there are effects of arbidol on prevention and early treatment.
In the current episode of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emergence [2], we find a spectacular example of possible repositioning of drugs, particularly chloroquine.
Lu also pointed out that there is no direct evidence that oseltamivir is effective in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [135] .
Currently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be tested (15,16) in patients with pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV and chloroquine as preventative medicine for COVID-19, as shown in Table 1.Immunoglobulins are useful in several diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), Kawasaki disease, and in multiple neurological autoimmune disorders refractory to standard immunosuppressive treatments (17).

66 For critically ill adults with COVID-19 who develop fever, acetaminophen might be a better choice for temperature control than NSAIDs.
27 The remaining parameters, including total protein (TP), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), platelet distribution width (PDW), and basophil (BA#), were rarely received extensive attention due to the lack of information on the clinical characteristics of affected patient.
We also examined the expression and abundance patterns of TMPRS22, a serine protease recently shown to be crucial for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein priming upon host cell entry 6 , as well as ADAM17, a sheddase that was shown to cleave (shed) ACE2 30 .
Currently, an RCT (Chinese Clinical Trial Register number: ChiCTR 2000029308) with 199 patients in Wuhan aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lopinavir and ritonavir regimen in severe COVID-19 patients.
95We also analyzed seven heparin anticoagulated convalescent (3-6 months post 96 infection) plasma samples from SARS-CoV infected patients.
reached similar conclusions, based on pharmacokinetic considerations [23] .Based on our simulations, we suggest that chloroquine may not be a "silver bullet" eradicating COVID-19 infection but, on the other side, it might display some beneficial effects in vivo .
She remained hemodynamically stable and was transitioned to oral anticoagulant therapy (apixaban) with plans to continue anticoagulation for 6 months.
Remdesivir works against coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in animal models, as well as against the related MERS-CoV, including in NHPs (Agostini et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2019; de Wit et al., 2020; Sheahan et al., 2017 Sheahan et al., , 2020 .
Considering the substantially higher potency that emetine appears to have against the coronavirus, doses of one fifth to one tenth of the doses used for the treatment of amoebiasis (0.1–0.2 mg/kg, intramuscularly; maximum 6-12 mg/day) could potentially be used.
Nonetheless, early strong indications for the efficacy of this paper prompted another group in France to prospectively study 11 consecutive COVID-19 patients with high comorbidity burden (in 8 out of 11) admitted under their care to be treated with the combination regimen of HCQ and azithromycin, in doses similar to those used in the Marseille study.
The main agents used included abidol, oseltamivir, ribavirin, ganciclovir, and recombinant interferon.
1 In addition to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, chloroquine has also shown promising results in the treatment of COVID-19.
It is prudent to not only react to current challenges, but also to anticipate future ones.
At such a dosage, a therapeutic concentration of chloroquine might be reached.
Recognition of modest antiviral effects shown for amantadine, rimantadine, memantine, and bananin in models for bovine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, human coronavirus OC43, and SARS-CoV, led to the suggestion that adamantanes could be repurposed for COVID-19 (Cimolai, 2020) .
Currently, at least ten clinical trials are testing chloroquine as an anti-COVID-19 therapy [55] .
Remdesivir is an investigational nucleotide analogue undergoing clinical development for Ebola and showing in vitro activity against coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV), and favorable effects in animal MERS models [24] [25] [26] [27] .Following these promising pre-clinical findings, RCT in COVID-19 patients have been initiated (see table 2 ).

À l'heure actuelle, aucune donnée n'a été collectée ou rapportée dans la littérature à ce sujet alors que de très nombreuses études rapportent les effets psychologiques, en termes de symptômes psychotiques, de l'isolement social, et cela dans des contextes très variés de solitude, de conditions extrêmes de détention carcérale, d'expéditions polaires ou sous-marines, de voyages dans l'espace, de certaines situations militaires, ou encore d'isolement de patients dans des unités de réanimation.
Furthermore, a clinical study of MERS-CoV suggested that the patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil has 0% mortality rate, which is significantly lower than the overall mortality rate as 37% 20 .
The patient was started on Normal Saline IV 2 L, Ceftriaxone 2 g IV QD, Azithromycin 500 mg IV QD empirically, albuterol nebulizer and Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO.
Of course, it is too early to conclude the direct antiviral effect of remdesivir on enhanced clearing of viral loads in the respiratory tract, but it indeed suggests a promising therapeutic effect of remdesivir.
Despite a lack of supporting evidence, some critical care experts advocate the use of low-dose corticosteroid therapy in adults with COVID-19 and refractory shock (e.g., intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg per day, as a "shock-reversal" strategy).
Metronomic oral vinorelbine and lungDuring Covid19 pandemic, oncologists worldwide must choose the best strategy for these "frail" patients in order to reduce side effects and maximize the outcomes.

sion, and cardiomyopathy (6) , and its use has markedly increased in the United States; clinicians should be alert to the possibility of increased risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes in methamphetamine users.
Unfortunately, traditional and social media coupled with world leader commentary have led some to believe hydroxychloroquine offers a bona fide cure and even prevention.
Such drugs will be amenable to routine parenteral administration through currently established routes and additionally, direct to the respiratory tract via nasal administration, using nebulised heparin, which would be unlikely to gain significant access to the circulation.
Finally, we do not have data on the lopinavir exposure levels in these seriously and often critically ill patients.
The in-vitro study has revealed the potent antiviral activity of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 [20-21].

In addition, paired trials of losartan as a treatment for Covid-19 are being conducted among patients who have not previously received treatment with a RAAS inhibitor and are either hospitalized (NCT04312009) or not hospitalized (NCT04311177).
Thus, SARS-CoV-2 uses the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming; camostat mesylate, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, blocked COVID-19 infection of lung cells, but inhibition was more substantial when the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B/L (CatB/L) was also inhibited e.g., with E-64d (40).
In addition, and in parallel to this study, we evaluated in vitro the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, and showed that there was a considerable synergy of these two substances when they were used at doses which mimic the concentrations likely to be obtained in humans (https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/03/Andreani-et-al.-Pre-print-V2.pdf).Other studies have pointed out that drug repurposing may identify approved drugs that could be useful for the treatment of this disease including, notably, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, as well as anti-diabetics such as metformin, angiotensin receptor inhibitors such as sartans, or statins such as simvastatin [11] .

We sustain the hypothesis that each city must be individually studied, but when we compare them, we can cluster and show patterns.
This is accompanied by the cooperative effect of the misfunctioning of the ACE2-ANG(1-7) axis of the RAS signalling system, that further contributes to the inflammatory response, while not anymore protecting lungs from injuries.-Increase of ACE2 content could favour viral invasion (evidence of ACE2 increase are found in scientific literature for mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRB), ibuprofen, ARBs-Sartans).-Substances could sequester or inactivate molecules that reduce ACE2 content; as an example, AT1r sequestering by ARBs (Sartans) increases ACE2 content on cell membranes.-Substances could favour shedding or internalization of ACE2m could decrease the viral infection rate, although side effects due to the decreased functioning of the ACE2-ANG(1-7) RAS signalling axis.-Exclusive treatments by ACE-inhibitors (not accompanied by ARBs (Sartan) treatments) could exert a protective effect.-Targeted actions based on deep diagnostics to reduce cytokine overload (not using general antiinflammatory treatments) should be provided since some cytokines appears to favour while others inhibit the viral infection (examples are reported in model here provided (Figure 1) ).-Information on cytokines average content from COVID-19 patients (critical or dead) are available from Wuhan patients and from SARS-CoV previous pandemic.
Four patients were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta-1b, and 9 patients were treated with this combination plus hydroxychloroquine.

25 Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody which acts as IL-6 receptor antagonist and is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
With the possible importance of aromatic rings and avoidance of escape mutations by the coronavirus in mind, a question is whether occasional loss of phenylalanine (F) from the KRSFIEDLLFNKV motif discussed above contests the tentative hypothesis that the peptidomimetic candidates derived from KRSFIEDLLFNKV bind to a similar site as the smaller organic ligands considered here, because of two phenylalanine residues (F) in the original motif and a tendency to several benzene rings in the case of organic ligands.
showed that a chloroquine concentration of 0.36 mg/L decreased viral load by 50% in a cell model [1] .Apart from the ongoing clinical evaluation of the efficacy of HCQ, little information is available concerning the modalities of administration of this drug for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, especially in the context of COVID-19.

The approved dose of ivermectin alone has a low probability of a success in the treatment of COVID-19.
Among other medications, he was on memantine, and there were no recent changes.
The concentration of teicoplanin required to inhibit 50% of viruses (IC 50 ) in vitro was 1.66 μM, which is much lower than the concentration reached in human blood (8.78 μM for a daily dose of 400 mg) [7] .
The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and placed under isolation and was given lopinavir antiviral therapy.
7 The recommendation has been made that low-molecular-weight heparin be considered in all such patients.
It predicts 339 that an overabundance of high mannose (as seen in the ferrets) or high MBL2 (as 340 seen in patients) can dysregulate the immune system, leading to severe damage 341 and death.
A combination of lopinavir and ritonavir is also under investigation in human cases of COVID-19 in China.
Treatment regimens for hospitalised COVID19 patients which result in whole blood chloroquine concentrations below 10µmol/L for more than 95% of patients have an acceptable safety margin.
14 Collectively, the suggestion of clinical benefit for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted with caution, as it is supported only by limited, and often times conflicting, clinical data.
However, several clinical trials are actively recruiting subjects to determine the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in adult patients.
The structure of these viruses includes a lipid envelope, which is easily disrupted by most disinfectants such as 62%À71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 min.
Current guidance recommends acetaminophen as first line treatment for fever in COVID-19 29 .
In clinical emergency or intensive care unit, pneumonia with unknown cause is accompanied by lymphocytopenia, elevated interleukin-6 level and other obvious abnormal laboratory parametres, clinicians should ask if the patients or their families have any contact history with COVID-19 patient, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid should be detected timely [10] .For the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, clinicians need to conduct clinical classification based on patient's clinical symptoms and laboratory test results (including chest CT).
5 The widely used antibiotic azithromycin is increasingly recognized as a rare cause of QT prolongation, 6,7 serious arrhythmias, 8, 9 and increased risk for sudden death 10 ; advanced age and female sex have been implicated as risk factors.
Basically, Sofosbuvir is a prodrug, which converts into active metabolite GS-461203 (2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate) and serve as a defective substrate for the nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) of RNA dependent RNA polymerase and further inhibits RNA synthesis (119) .
Currently, the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine found to be a treatment option for COVID-19.
As a result of this hyper-inflammatory state, the authors suggested the use of Fedratinib, a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) small molecule inhibitor which is involved in the suppression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), as a potential therapeutic agent for patients with elevated Th17 (but also Th1) type immune profiles [8, 9] .It would therefore be of great interest to further strengthen this hypothesis by accessing bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma/serum samples from mild-and severe-infected COVID-19 patients to measure IL-17 levels.
His SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR test returned positive and he was started on lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100mg every 12 hours and nitazoxanide 500mg every 12 hours for 7 days.
Currently, no specific medications have been Certain epilepsy medications may affect the immune system, including everolimus and steroids that are used for tuberous sclerosis complex and autoimmune epilepsy, respectively.
As the virus first originated in China and rapidly diffused across Asia and then Europe, the Americas, and Africa, countries experienced delayed contagion patterns and, consequently, started to react with policies and interventions at different periods (Wilder- Smith and Freedman, 2020) .
Our findings suggest that ciclesonide inhalant may improve the respiratory status in severe COVID-19-induced pneumonia and is worthy of further study in clinical trials.
Some monoclonal antibodies (for example, anti-CD38 antibodies such as daratumumab and isatuximab) result specifically in NK-cell depletion and increase risk of lower respiratory viral infection, while it is unclear whether this also applies to COVID-19 (Nahi et al.
Screening cases on the day of visit ::: Examination routines of SARS-CoV-2 infected patient ::: Diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patientsNucleic acid examination of sputum or naso-/oropharyngeal swabs, complete blood count, urine analysis, arterial blood gas analysis, liver and kidney function, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, creatine kinase plus myoglobin, coagulation, and chest CT should be performed.
Although agreement is not required, there was agreement (DI < 1) in 64 of 76 scenarios (84%).• The panel agreed that having IBD (either CD or UC) did not increase the risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 or developing COVID-19 and having an ostomy or J-pouch did not increase the risk for COVID-19.• The panel also agreed that it is safe to continue to receive infusions in an infusion center, assuming that the infusion center has a SARS-CoV-2 screening protocol in place.• The group was in agreement that it is appropriate to reduce the dose or discontinue prednisone to prevent infection from SARS-CoV-2, but voted that it was inappropriate to reduce the dose or stop other IBD therapies to prevent infection from SARS-CoV-2.• There were mixed responses related to the other clinical scenarios and therapies.
However, no apparent activity of oseltamivir and zanamivir was previously observed against SARS-CoV-1 in vitro [28] , and the fact that up to 76% of the first critically ill patients with COVID-19 received oseltamivir may also be related to the suspicion of infection (or co-infection) with influenza [29] .
Fourth, although one case responded well to remdesivir [7] and one in vitro study [37] showed that remdesivir and chloroquine were promising for the treatment of COVID-19, further clinical trials on the effectiveness of remdesivir and chloroquine for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia should be conducted.
Our patient received 5 days of chloroquine per 5 days at 600 mg per day (divided into two doses, 300 mg/day base).
A considerable amount of scientific efforts is focused on the development of treatments, concerning which several studies appeared on the safety and efficacy of chloroquine and its variants such as hydroxychloroquine (Liu et al., 2020a) as potential treatment for COVID-19 (Cortegiani et al., 2020; Devaux et al., 2020) .

Therefore, repurpose of existing antiviral agents including interferon, chloroquine (an antimalarial agent) and niclosamide (a broad spectrum anthelminthic) have attracted considerable attention and many trials are underway (4, 5) .
This aciddependent process may explain the proposed efficacy of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, as lysosomotropic agent, in the treatment of COVID-19 36 (Fig.
Investments should proceed in tandem to build national systems for delivery of potential vaccines-eg, using domestic financing and external financing from the World Bank Group's $14 billion COVID-19 Fast Track Facility 13 and reallocations from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Gavi, and Global Financing Facility grants for service delivery.
We previously emphasised interest in chloroquine for the treatment of viral infections in this journal [1] , predicting its use in viral infections lacking drugs.
Notwithstanding direct viral cytopathic effects, as hyperinflammation drives forward local and systemic endothelial dysfunction and injury, this results in increased vascular permeability, excess thrombin generation (also a major activator of platelets) and inhibition of fibrinolysis [27].
MITIGATING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF DI-TDP AND DI-SCD ASSOCIATED WITH WIDESPREAD USE OF CHLOROQUINE/ HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMICAlthough some might argue that DI-SCDs in the setting of widespread chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine use represents acceptable "friendly fire" in the war on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, we believe that with the institution of a few simple and safe precautions, the risk of DI-TdP and DI-SCD can be mitigated.
Chloroquine was shown by in vitro experiments to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Keyaerts et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2020).
In these studies, the incidence of liver injury ranged from 14.8% to 78%, mainly presenting with abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) accompanied by slightly elevated bilirubin levels [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19].
Although the use of chloroquine may be supported by expert opinion, clinical use of this drug in patients with COVID-19 should adhere to the MEURI framework or after ethical approval as a trial as stated by the WHO.
No differences were observed during viral shedding after treatment with Kaletra (combined drug Lopinavir and Ritonavir).
Moreover, nitrogen oxide is a free radical and can be oxidized to nitrogen dioxide, which acts as a pulmonary irritant 26 .Ozone is a secondary by-product of traffic-related air pollution and is generated through sunlight-driven reactions between motor-vehicle emissions and volatile organic compounds 27 .

In the wild type Sars-CoV-2 sequence, we find 3 Phenylalanine residues just before position, where we find a Leucine.
35, 36 An in vitro study on the timeof-addition assay in Vero E6 cells demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry and at post-entry stages of COVID-19, and the EC90 value of chloroquine against the 2019-nCoV was 6.90 mM.
However, ribavirin had severe side effects such as anemia 18 and whether it had sufficient antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear.
SARS ::: TreatmentsThe combination regimen of steroids and ribavirin was the treatment protocols for SARS in Hong Kong (So et al., 2003).
On the other hand this makes that these time series, in view of the relative large incubation period for the COVID-19 infection, did not have the time to react to the restrictive measures taken by the Italian government and to the modified habits of the population; thus in building our model we will consider the epidemic parameters as being constant over the time covered by these data.
Factors related to early renal injury in COVID-19In this study, Spearman correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the correlation between renal function indicators (eGFR, Ccr, and UACR) and the obviously abnormal biochemical indicators (C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil ratio (NER), monocyte ratio (MOR), serum potassium (K), serum sodium (Na), and albumin (ALB)).
We used hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BID on day one, then 200 mg BID for four days in combination with Azithromycin 500 mg PO QD.

In 2020, Remdesivir as a novel and promising medicine for COVID-2019 has gained Orphan Drug designation from FDA.
Based on the above considerations, the hypothesis arises that testosterone may have a role in the cascade of events leading to progression of COVID-19 infection due to the cytokine storm.
The entry mechanism of a coronavirus depends upon cellular proteases which include, human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), cathepsins and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that split the spike protein and establish further penetration changes [28], [29].
Additionally, the shift in priority of primary care to triage suspected COVID-19 patients may limit the time available for routine visits (e.g., tracking CVD risk factors, such as hypertension, cholesterol, and diabetes -which have previously demonstrated survival benefit), supporting smoking cessation, and providing psychosocial support, despite the emergence of telehealth visits.
While the combination of HCQ with azithromycin resulted in 100% viral clearance in 6 patients, HCQ alone resulted in %57 clearance in 14 patients (P < 0.001) [14].

Likewise, strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by 397 knockdown of TMPRSS2 activity using T-ex5 PPMO or treatment of Calu-3 cells with 398 aprotinin, MI-432 and MI-1900, respectively, indicates that furin cannot compensate for the 399 lack of TMPRSS2 in S activation.
2,4Kidney, liver and cardiac injuryKidney injury prevalence (via creatinine measurement) at admission is unknown but 11-15% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients may have acute kidney injury.
However, the activities of many of these, in particular chloroquine derivatives, have not been recapitulated in clinical trials 17, 18 .
Moreover, the authors highlighted that hydroxychloroquine half maximal effective concentration values “tended to decrease with longer incubation times” and that, in the simulation model, the lung trough concentrations were still above the target concentration on day 10 after a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine.
Previous studies showed the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir may be beneficial for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients [31, 32].
Furthermore, glycine, proline, as well as hydrophobic amino acids were exposed on the surface of partial nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 to play as a part of a virulence factor (nsp1) and stimulate the human immune system [74, 75].
Therefore, hydroxychloroquine should be considered as a primary option to apply to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients, which could save lives during the current COVID-19 pandemic despite that randomized-double blind control study is needed to provide All rights reserved.
There are currently 12 registered trials to investigate convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins in COVID-19 (Table 1A : Plasma-Based Therapies).Alternative Treatment Strategies Various other treatment strategies are currently under investigation, including the antifibrotic/inflammatory agent pirfenidone (used in treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), and the antiangiogenic agents: bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) and thalidomide (Table 1A : Antifibrotics and Antiangiogenics).

Follow-up:Our patient received hydroxychloroquine and low dose glucocorticoids as per our institutional treatment protocol, however, it is important to note that currently there is no proven data for efficacy of this regimen for COVID-19.
The structures reveal how the template-primer RNA is recognized by the enzyme and the inhibition of the chain elongation by Remdesivir.
Since endogenous nitrogen oxide is known to inhibit RSV replication in the lungs, it has been proposed that exogenous, inhaled nitrogen oxide may trigger RSV replication by repressing the production of endogenous nitrogen oxide 25 .Although a similar mechanism of replication has not been shown for SARS-CoV-2, it is tempting to speculate a possible association between nitrogen oxide levels and SARS-CoV-2 lethality.
The saRNA LNP groups that received 0.01-10 μ g ranged from 1,000-2,600 SFU/10 6 was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The CONUT score and PNI were first used to estimate the correlation between malnutrition risks and postoperative complications in patients with gastrointestinal tumors, and there was increasing evidence that they were also related to the prognosis of other malnourished malignancies and diseases [24, 25, 26, 27] .We know that the CONUT score is calculated based on 3 laboratory variables, serum albumin,lymphocytes, and total cholesterol (range 0-12, higher = worse).One study on COVID-19 confirmed that most patients had lymphopenia when they were admitted to the hospital, and that there was a decrease in albumin [28] .
Indeed, many patients have a profile to suggest a prothrombotic diathesis including high levels of fibrin degradation products (D-dimer), elevated fibrinogen levels, and low antithrombin levels 24, 25 .Here, we report four cases of COVID-19-associated VTE.
However, as an experimental drug, remdesivir is not expected to be largely available for treating a very large number of patients in a timely manner.
So in the treatment, we mainly focused on symptomatic and supportive treatment in the early stage, such as adequate supplementation of albumin, plasma and potassium, in order to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment and adequately reactivate body immunity to clean up sars-cov-2 by themselves, which is consistent with Lei Zhang's opinion [18] .At the same time, continuous application of small doses of glucocorticoid should be avoided in case of suppressing the body's immune function at this stage.
In the resulting ranked list, we rediscovered Chloroquine as well as Deferoxamine, both of which are currently in clinical trial or discussed in the literature as candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

The active site is situated in the center of the substrate domain where RNA synthesis takes place on the entry of the RNA template from template entry channel and NTP (Nucleoside Triphosphate) through the NTP entry channel (Peersen OB., 2017) .
It is interesting to note that 6 patients were prescribed azithromycin “to prevent bacterial super-infection” and the investigators found that viral eradication was numerically superior in this subgroup (6 of 6, 100%) compared with those who received hydroxychloroquine alone (8 of 14, 57%).
Interestingly, the initial, high permeability-type permeability oedema phenotype that characterises SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with apparently preserved lung mechanics, while undergoing positive pressure MV, may shift to the typical ARDS phenotype in absence of timely weaning MV.A closer look at the pathophysiology of this hypoxemic alveolar state reveals that a decrease in venous admixture induced by decreasing in transpulmonary blood flow may be obtained mechanically (PPV), chemically (nitroglycerin in cardiogenic pulmonary oedema), by body posture (reverse Trendelenburg positioning) or a combination of these.
A clinical trial from more than 100 patients also demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate was superior to the control treatment for inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion and shortening the disease course, which are symptoms during the severe stage of illness in COVID-19 [9] .

Remdesivir is poorly water soluble but is solubilized by Captisol allowing for IV administration on an experimental basis to patients.
Baricitinib also serves as an inhibitor of adaptor-associated kinase 1 (AAK1, a member of the numb-associated kinase family), which plays a central role in regulating endocytosis through which the virus invades host cells (Fig.
This has led in China to include chloroquine in the recommendations regarding the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia [4 , 6] .
2 There are reports that remdesevir and antimalarial agent, chloroquine effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Patients on immunosuppressive treatments such as thiopurines or methotrexate, steroids or other immunosuppressants (22% of our cohort) and patients on biologic treatment (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab, Golimumab) (16 %) continued their current dosage without noting any symptoms leading to diagnose COVID-19.
In addition, chloroquine phosphate (used to prevent and treat malaria and some inflammatory conditions) was found to have acceptable safety and demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody binding to IL6 receptor and inhibiting its signal transduction.
Interestingly, while few clinical studies have suggested that the use of HCQ alone or with azithromycin (AZT) could be beneficial for COVID-19 patients as it reduces viral shedding and time to clinical recovery [162] [163] [164] , others have reported no effect in infected patients [165, 166] .
None of the predicted drugs could completely prevent CPE, though chloroquine could at the dose of 15 µM.
With regard to specific antiviral therapies, although a recent trial showed no benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, it remains possible that treatment with these drugs as well as hydroxychloroquine will be considered in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
Altogether, one of us (DR) has treated ~40 0 0 cases of C. burnetii or T. whipplei infections over 30 years (personal data).Regarding viruses, for reasons probably partly identical involving alkalinisation by chloroquine of the phagolysosome, several studies have shown the effectiveness of this molecule, including against coronaviruses among which is the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus [1 , 12 , 13] ( Table 1 ) .
6 The diagnosis of 2019-nCoV neonatal infection should meet all the following requirements: (1) showing at least one of the clinical symptoms, including temperature instability, hypoactivity or poor feeding, or tachypnoea; (2) showing abnormal findings on chest radiograph, including unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacity, multiple lobular, or subsegmental areas of consolidation; • Standard precautions include signage at the entrance, strict hand and respiratory hygiene, daily cleaning and disinfection of the environment, and provision of gloves, mask, and goggles for all medical staff • Additional enhanced contact precautions and respiratory droplet precautions include patients' own dedicated equipment, limited parents' visits, gown and glove change after procedures, and opening window regularly to change air • Avoid breastfeeding from mothers with probable or laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection until the recovery of confirmed mothers or rejection of probable infection • Medical waste generated during medical service should be collected into a double-layer infectious waste bag, which should be treated with chlorine-containing preparation for at least 10 min, then disposed of in the same way as infectious medical waste • Terminal disinfection of the patient's room is preferentially done using hydrogen peroxide atomisation or a chlorine-containing preparation spray work and chest radiography, and initialisation of respiratory support if necessary.

This experiment demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine was more effective at impairing viral replication compared to chloroquine when given post-infection, with a 48-hour EC50 of 0.72µM and 5.47µM for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine respectively [39].
Therefore, trials of losartan as a treatment for Covid-19 are underway enrolling patients who have not previously received treatment with ACEIs or ARBs.
In view of adverse reactions and the lack of in vitro efficacy, the use of ribavirin should be seriously considered for the treatment of COVID‐19, even in combination with other antiviral drugs.
(36) A further study was undertaken, in which the RNA-dependent polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 was modelled, validated and then targeted using anti-polymerase drugs currently registered for use against various viruses (Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir and Tenofovir).
After binding, the S protein is cleaved by a host membrane serine protease, TMPRSS2, facilitating viral entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020) .Based on our understanding of SARS and MERS, and their similarity to COVID-19, the human immune response in mild cases is likely characterized by a robust type I interferon antiviral response and CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ T cell response, resulting in viral clearance.
[9] noted in their prospective case series of 11 severe COVID-19 patients that HCQ plus azithromycin, in doses similar to that used in the study by Gautret et al.

[42] Among other diabetic medications, the use of liraglutide and pioglitazone have also been found to be related with increased ACE2 regulation in animal studies.
At present data on testosterone can be collected systematically at one or more institutions.
In this setting, hydroxychloroquine may be an ideal drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection as it can inhibit the virus via its antiviral effects and help mediate the cytokine storm via its immunomodulatory effects.
Has the emergence of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine sparked some optimism?Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, an analog of chloroquine, have been traditionally used as anti-malarial agents and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS) in conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
Specifically, this molecule has been previously shown to suppress herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of HSV-encoded cysteine protease 68 , which may indicate that the antiviral function of Z LVG CHN2 occurs through inhibition of SARS-COV-2 3CLpro protease.
In addition, remdesivir also predicted to bind with the human TMPRSS2, a protein facilitating the virus infection, this is a new discovery and provides ideas for subsequent research.
Given that Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), which is the common active triphosphate form of TAF or TDF, is much smaller than natural nucleoside triphosphates, we expect that it can easily fit within the active site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
The threat of COVID-19 has required healthcare services to react and adapt their working patterns.
The authors, claiming that Fleiss" formula with continuity correction was used, calculated that 21 subjects per group were required ("assume …10% loss to follow-up, we calculated that a total of 48 COVID-19 patients (ie, 24 cases in the hydroxychloroquine group and 24 in the control group) would be required for the analysis (Fleiss with CC)" 4 ), which implied that they assumed the effect of the control group would be around 5%, i.e., 1 out of the 24 in the control group would achieve a viral load clearance.
Recently, hydroxychloroquine has shown to be effective in COVID-19 patients [7] and its efficiency has been reportedly reinforced by azithromycin for virus elimination [8] , despite there is no well-controlled, randomized clinical evidence support azithromycin therapy in COVID-19 [9] .CoVs are single-stranded positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) viruses with 5'-cap and 3'-poly-A tail.
Compared with the untreated control group, arbidol can effectively inhibit coronavirus up to 60 times at a concentration of 10e30 mmol/L, and significantly inhibit the virus's pathological effects on cells.

Inside the cells, chloroquine becomes rapidly protonated and is concentrated in endosomes [27].
Through randomization, 34 patients were assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol, and 17 to no antiviral medication as control.
Crucially, heparin and its derivatives, some of which, lacking significant anticoagulant activity 1 , are an under-exploited antiviral drug class, despite possessing broad-spectrum activity against a multitude of distinct viruses, including coronaviridae and SARS-associated coronavirus strains 2,3 , in addition to flaviviruses 4,5 , herpes 6 , influenza 7 and HIV 8, 9 .Traditional drug development processes are slow and ineffective against emerging public health threats such as the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak which makes the repurposing of existing drugs a timely and attractive alternative.
Several significant predictors increased the risk for in-hospital death and decreased chance of recovery including age, BMI, oxygen saturation, elevated respiratory rate, WBC, creatinine and ALT (Fig.
A more in-depth understanding of the disease is crucial for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.The potential benefits of several other agents against SARS-CoV-2 are currently being investigated (i.e., hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, corticosteroids, antiinflammatory agents, antiviral drugs, convalescent plasma transfusion) and numerous compounds are in development.
Most of these infected patients had mild-to-moderate elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels; one patient had severely elevated serum aminotransferases (ALT of 7590 U/L, AST of 1445 U/L).5 Since COVID-19-related liver dysfunction is now attracting widespread attention, this review discusses the epidemiological characteristics, the potential mechanisms, and the treatment options for liver dysfunction induced by COVID-19.
81 Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess an unique ability to increase the pH of lysosomes and hence prevent SARS-CoV-2 viral fusion and replication.
Due to lack of protein structures with remdesivir, we followed the steps of Y. Gao and collaborators [19] and analyzed binding residues of HCV RNA directed RNA polymerase (pdb id 4wtg) to sofosbuvir and compared them to binding residues in Covid-19 RNA directed RNA polymerase (pdb id 6m71).
It should be noted that remdesivir is a prodrug, and the active form is the transformed nucleoside triphosphate (NTP, Fig.
34, 35 Other countries affected by this pandemic like South Korea and China have drafted guidelines for the use of HCQ and chloroquine for therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.Due to lack of an effective alternative drugs for treating sick patients in intensive care set up, especially with co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and immunocompromized status, various drug regulatory authorities have allowed the use of HCQ.
However, the phenyl ring at the P1′ site of both HIV-1 protease inhibitors and 13bremains the same, and the P2 (larger and more hydrophilic than 13b) and P2′ (foundonly in HIV-1 protease inhibitors) regions of lopinavir and ritonavir strongly interactedwith SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro at the S2 and S2′ pockets, respectively (Figure 3).
The main task of public health authorities is to react quickly to emerging pathogens of global threat to prevent spread.
SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat and can be inactivated under conditions of a temperature of 56°C for 30 minutes or by using 75% alcohol, a chlorine-containing disinfectant, and chloroform.
[4] ; key points as below: o QT interval monitoring for all patients commenced on hydroxychloroquine or when combining anti-viral drugs for COVID-19 o Avoid the use of more than one medication which prolongs the QT interval as far as is possible o If the corrected QT interval (QTc) is consistently >500ms, we recommend consultation with a cardiogenetics expert or an electrophysiologist for guidance on further management to minimise risk of Torsade de Pointes.• In patients with LQTS with significant gastrointestinal complications of COVID-19 (e.g.
In both general ARDS and sepsis, significant evidence supports a procoagulatory state characterized by massive thrombin production [44].

The currently proposed therapy for COVID-19 patients include hydroxychloroquine for all cases with the addition of the lopinavir-ritonavir for severe cases and those requiring intensive care unit admission.
In our opinion, hydroxychloroquine should be preferred over chloroquine because of its less toxic profile (reduced ocular toxicity and less drug interactions) and its more potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 [40] .Recently, Cortegiani and colleagues reviewed the available information on ongoing case series, comparative observational studies, and RCT evaluating the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19 and registered in Chinese or U.S. registries [41] .
Recently, Wang and co-workers reported that Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus infection, and the anti-malarial drug chloroquine are effective to inhibit 2019-nCoV replication in vitro (Wang et al.
22 The exact anti-viral mechanism of hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 is incompletely understood, but may relate to impaired angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor binding and resultant cell entry, as well as the suppression of "cytokine storm".
On the basis of expert opinion and available data in January, 2020, we considered that remdesivir might be the best potential drug for the treatment of COVID-19, although restricted to patients with severe disease (intravenous route, a loading dose of 200 mg, then maintenance daily dose of 100 mg for a total duration of 10 days).
The synergistic effects of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combination were also reported to treat COVID-19 patients [16] .

CASE REPORTIn January 2020, a 53-year-old gentleman with a background of asthma on long-term low dose inhaled corticosteroid inhaler had an acute exacerbation of his asthma in February 2020 triggered by a viral upper respiratory tract infection and acute sinusitis and was managed with bronchodilator nebulization and a 7-day course of oral prednisone 30 mg daily.
He, he was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime which are standard treatments for suspected community-acquired pneumonia.
Using the Spearman method, we further correlated the C t value (viral load) of the 2019-nCoV virus with biochemical and clinical indexes, and found that the levels of infectious diseases indicators albumin (ALB), and percentage of immunological cells of LYM, and NEU were significantly correlated with infected 2019-nCoV viral load ( Figure 3B ).Among the eight blood biochemistry indexes distinguished in blood samples of 2019-nCoV infected patients, specifically ALB, creatinine (CRE), LYM, LYM (%), NEU (%), LDH, CRP, and CD8, we found ALB, LYM, LYM (%), NEU (%), LDH, and CRP were highly linked to lung injury Murray score (Figure 4 ).
Interestingly, the all of the drugs we found to be inhibitors of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the established Huh-7 cell line (chloroquine, arbidol, toremifene, clomiphene, amodiaquine, verapamil, and amiodarone) were independently shown recently by others to also inhibit infection of Vero cells by native SARS-CoV-2 virus, author/funder.
To test whether S protein was cleaved by trypsin in the current study, we first purified PDCoV virions and then treated them with different concentrations (1, 5, 10, 20 μg/ml) of trypsin at 37°C for 2 h. We did not obviously detect S protein cleavage (Figure 2(E)); thus, we think trypsin is not involved in the PDCoV entry process in LLC-PK or ST cells.
However, it's hardly to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir and chloroquine until results of the trials are released.
The biochemistry indexes associated with the function of heart, i.e., creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin (MYO), cardiac troponin 1 (Ctn1), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and CK myocardial band (CK-MB), were significantly elevated in case 4 (Table 2) , and ultrasonic cardiogram results showed that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 32%, and the left ventricular diameter (LV) was 61 mm on Jan 15, 2020 (5 days after illness onset) ( Figure S2 in Supporting Information).We used the Spearman correlation coefficient to calculate the correlation between 2019-nCoV virus cycle threshold (C t ) value, which is reciprocal to virus load, with clinical disease severity scores, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II Score, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 )/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratios, and Murray scores of infected patients ( Figure 3A ; Figure S3 and Table S1 in Supporting Information).
Interestingly, the CD147 partners, cyclophilins, play an important role in the replication process of coronavirus, and cyclophilins' inhibitor, cyclosporine, can effectively suppress the intracellular propagation of virus.

Since the most common haematological changes in COVID-19 patients were lymphopenia and immunodeficiency, we postulate that hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF, by mobilizing endogenous blood stem cells and endogenous cytokines, may represent a potential haematological treatment for COVID-19 patients 12 .Interestingly, a noticeable increase of glutathione reductase (GR) level occurred in 40.2% of the COVID-19 patients in our cohort, while ALT and AST are normal in most patients.
Interestingly, studies showed that ACE2 is a constitutive product of adult-type Leydig cells 15 , thus implying a role in testicular function and suggesting a possible involvement of testicle in COVID-19 infected patients, a factor which may affect testosterone secretion.
Long QT syndrome (LQTS)• There are no data to suggest patients with LQTS are at increased risk from COVID-19 infection.• We recommend all betablockers are continued in patients with LQTS during their illness.• Some experimental therapies for COVID-19 (such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and ritonavir) are known to prolong the QT interval, and may cause acquired LQTS even in patients without congenital LQTS; therefore, we advise great caution in use of these medications [3] .
However, to get a complete clearance of virus, chloroquine is combined with other drugs.
Previous studies have shown that HCoV-OC43 N-NTD contained adenosine monophosphate (AMP)/uridine monophosphate (UMP)/cytosine monophosphate (CMP)/guanosine monophosphate (GMP) binding site alongside the middle two β-strands of its β-sheets core 41 .

With this novel pathogenic threat, there is much that is not yet known, and many ways this virus could impact the rheumatology community (panel).PanelScientific and clinical challenges facing the rheumatology community during the COVID-19 pandemic•Elucidating the host response to viral infection and risk factors for progression to severe or critical disease and mortality, particularly in the context of the aging immune system•Identifying potential genetic susceptibility factors that influence the risk of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 and mortality from COVID-19•Identifying optimal management strategies for patients on immunosuppressant medications with consideration of SARS-CoV-2•Understanding the short-term and long-term multisystem effects of COVID-19•Measuring the outcomes of patients with specific rheumatological conditions who are infected with SARS-CoV-2•Addressing anticipated drug shortages for hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, anakinra, and other medications commonly in use in rheumatology•Working through unprecedented logistical and ethical challenges (eg, rapidly setting up global registries and en masse transitions to telehealth)COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.
If ibuprofen is indeed associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, whether or not a possible association would relate to the specific agent ibuprofen or the larger group of NSAIDs would require further investigation.
In addition, chloroquine has demonstrated its efficacy in Chinese COVID-19 patients in clinical trials by reducing fever, improving CT imaging, and delaying disease progression [12] [13] [14] , leading Chinese experts to recommend chloroquine-based treatment (500 mg twice per day for ten days) as a first line-treatment for mild, moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 [15] .In a preliminary clinical trial on a small cohort of COVID-19 patients, we demonstrated that those treated with hydroxychloroquine (600 mg per day, N = 20 patients) had a significant reduction in viral carriage at D6-post inclusion, with 70% of patients testing negative for the virus through nasopharyngeal PCR, compared to untreated controls (N = 16) with only 12.5% patients testing negative using PCR at D6post inclusion [16] .
47 Yao et al used physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models and found 402 that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENTTo date, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 nor is there a vaccine currently available, however clinical trials are in effect with medications such as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, aerosolized alpha-interferon, tocilizumab and remdesivir (an RNA polymerase inhibitor) 28 Additionally, laboratory abnormalities, hepatic injury, and pancreatic injury have been evident in a subset of patients, ranging on a spectrum with the severity of disease.
One study suggests anticoagulation, mainly with low molecular weight heparin, may be associated with reduced mortality in severe COVID-19 infections or those with D-dimer greater than six times the upper limit of normal [39] .
Remdesivir: The experimental drug is a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development by Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Although there is no approved specific medication to treat COVID-19, the antimalarials hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been investigated due to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity.
The china international exchange and promotive association for medical and health care (CPAM) recommend using anti-SARS properties of lopinavir and ritonavir capsule for older age COVID-19 patients with the underlying condition and serious symptoms, these capsules should be used for emergency cases (Chu et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2020; Y. H. Jin et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 is eliminated by common detergents, 32, 40 and ultra violet irradiation and ozone treatment should be used in endoscopy units to clean and sterilise the air, endoscopic equipment, office tables, and walls.

The EC90 value of remdesivir in Vero E6 cells against SARS-CoV-2 was 1.76 μM, indicating that its working concentration is likely to be attained in NHP models.
The patient was treated with oxygen support by nasal cannula, regular hemodialysis, antihypertensive medications, moxifloxacin (400 mg daily), and lopinavir/ritonavir (2 tablets twice daily) antiviral therapy.
These data demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD protein binds specifically to heparin immobilised through its reducing-end and fails to bind to the underlying streptavidin / ethyleneglycol surface.
Absolute lymphocyte blood counts were compared before and after Tocilizumab infusion.
Ongoing trials of IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab, which shown effective against cytokine release syndrome resulting from CAR-T cell infusion against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, may be expanded to restore T cell counts and treat severe 2019-nCoV infection (Le et al., 2018) .
The possible interference of chloroquine with sialic acid biosynthesis could account for the broad antiviral spectrum of that drug since viruses such as the human coronavirus HCoV-O43 and the orthomyxoviruses use sialic acid moieties as receptors [58] .
In spite of the first-reported case in the U.S. showing promptly-subsided fever after Remdesivir used on day 12 of illness, with well-improved clinical symptoms later, the effectiveness of Remdesivir was still questioned.
34 All cases received a three-drug regimen, which included oseltamivir 75 mg PO every 12 hours for 5 days, hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg PO daily or chloroquine sulfate 1000 mg tablet PO as a single dose and lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg PO every 12 hours for 5 days.
For example, we find that mitoxantrone (HUVEC, 10, µM , 24h) perturbs COVID-19 targets related to cell cycle, viral life cycle, protein transport and organelle organization.
These results together provide the molecular details of baicalein recognition by SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and an explanation for the observed potent activity of such a small molecule against the protease.
Heparin, a welltolerated anticoagulant pharmaceutical, has been used safely in medicine for over 80 years and, alongside its anticoagulant activities, its ability to prevent viral infection, including by members of the Coronaviridae, has been described 2 .

6 The earliest Phase 3 studies of remdesivir in COVID-19-infected patients started after the publication of that study.
The usages of corticosterone, arbidol, oseltamivir and intravenous antibiotics was 14.81% (12/81), Table 1 .Compared to the control group, COVID-19 patients had significantly higher serum .
The oxygen atom of the aldehyde group also plays a crucial role in stabilizing the conformations of the inhibitor by forming a 2.9-Å hydrogen bond with the backbone of residues Cys145 in the S1′ site.
Together, these results demonstrated 208 the critical evidence that robust adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 209 infection exist in severe stage and remain after Tocilizumab treatment.
32 Our study suggested that tocilizumab use prior to ventilation in ICU may be optimal since 50% of such cases died, remain ventilated and serious superinfection.
Considering the current public health crisis, we aimed to unravel the potential drug target, molecular interactions and address the mechanism of action of Arbidol on SARS-CoV-2.
Interferons, with or without ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and are being trialed in China for 2019-nCoV.
Simvastatin is another drug which is known to upregulate autophagy via the mTOR pathway (Wei et al., 2013) .
51,53These findings, along with the safety profile of remdesivir in the clinical trial assessmentagainst EBOV,54 support the evaluation of remdesivir as a potentialtherapeutic drug for repurposing against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
13 Regarding to clinical researches, currently, the results of lopinavir-ritonavir, arbidol and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate on COVID-19 treatment have been reported in 6 studies.
The secondary structure prediction study shows a large numbers of cysteine residues which contribute to the formation of disulfide bonds within the spike protein.
As IL-6 receptor antagonists, TCZ and sarilumab have therefore been hypothesized to exert suppressive effects on exuberant and dysfunctional systematic inflammation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and further improve patients' condition.
[36] [37] [38] A recent open label non randomized clinical trial reported that hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients.
As in any patient with severe infection/sepsis/hypoxia, use of metformin in COVID-19 does theoretically increase the risk of lactic acidosis (6) .
Analysis of the RBD sequence for potential heparin binding sites employing a metric based on the Levenshtein distance (a measure of the similarity between two sequences) found that the basic amino acids sequences within SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD were similar to 278 sequences found in 309 heparin binding proteins.
Emodin or promazine blocks interaction between S-protein and ACE-2, therefore, it could abolish SARS-CoV infection by being a competitive inhibitor [17].
A meta-analysis conducted with a total of 6548 patients with influenza pneumonia (H7N9 or H1N1), found the use of systemic GCs (methylprednisolone with different dose ranges, when reported) associated with higher mortality rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-2.36, Z = 3.71, P = 0.0002), longer intensive care unit permanence and higher rate of secondary infection [44] [45] [46] .
Before Coronavirus emergency, our protocol required that patients perform blood test and hospital visit every 4 weeks; after March 8 th 2020 (Prime Minister Decree-law, in Italy), we still had 10 patients in treatment with metronomic vinorelbine.
Some practitioners in rectal cancer opted, in the absence of recommendations to substitute oral capecitabine for 5-FU whenever possible, and to adopt short course radiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting with delaying surgical interventions (75) .An algorithm was also proposed by a northern Italian group of radiation oncology that insisted on continuing to deliver treatment for cancer patients with adoption of hypo fractionated protocols whenever possible, while withholding radiotherapy for benign disease or postponing it if possible, in the adjuvant setting, and withholding treatment only for confirmed or highly suspicious cases of COVID-19 (76) .After reviewing the above resources, we conclude that efforts are gathered to establish management strategies in Italy, but no tool is available to date to test the efficacy and safety of these propositions.
217The mutant included two stabilizing proline mutations at residues 986, 987 and a 218 "GSAS" substitution at the furin cleavage site 7 .
It is hypothesized that lopinavir and ritonavir exhibit their efficacy by inhibiting the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 20 ( Figure 1D ).In addition to repurposing existing antiviral drugs, drugs used to modulate the host Viral targets for development of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoVThe spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays an essential role in virus entry into host cells and is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies 5, 9 (Figures 1C,D) .
There, IL-6R inhibition with tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R antibody) proved effective and was FDA approved in 2017.
Remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue-based drug that is currently under clinical trial for treating Ebola virus infection, has been shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro (Wang et al.
Outcome in two relatively larger sample studies suggest that about 3% to 10% of patients infected with 2019-nCoV had abnormal renal function, including elevated creatinine or urea nitrogen.
After SARS-CoV-2 was detected, the patient was transferred to the infectious disease unit of our hospital and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (400/100 mg twice a day) associated with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice a day) was promptly started.
68 However, the administered dose of methylprednisolone is not specified in that investigation.
La estimación de la magnitud de dicho impacto resulta compleja, porque los casos declarados de muerte por COVID-19 podrían infraestimar las muertes directamente o indirectamente relacionadas con ella.
 Serine protease TMPRSS2 is involved in priming the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for cellular entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.
They may also have an accompanying serum lactate level of >2 mmol/L.Laboratory FeaturesLaboratory findings specific to COVID-19 include elevated prothrombin time, LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), D-dimer, ALT, C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatine kinase [9].
RESULTSAfter confirming expression of the pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in vitro (Supplementary Figure 1) , mice were immunized with saRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated in LNP with doses ranging from 0.01 to 10 μ g ( Figure 1a ).
Chloroquine, in addition to its immunomodulating properties, has been shown to have antiviral activity at entry and post-entry stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
More recently, tyrphostin A9, a platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor came out from a high-throughput screening using cytopathic effect as readout, it also showed in vitro inhibitory capacity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an alpha coronavirus that infects pigs (Dong et al., 2020) .
Of the target regimens, chloroquine therapy is being considered [2] .
SARS-CoV-2 binds with its own spike glycoprotein to ACE2 and uses the serine protease TMPRSS2 for priming.
While the medical evidence on the association between Ibuprofen and COVID-19 was doubtful, the alleged source of the story (a research institution in Vienna) denied the existence of a study conducted by said institution.
Thus decreasing IL-6 levels in COVID-19 may promote increased viral replication if tocilizumab is used too early in the disease course.
To date, there are no studies of hydroxychloroquine as treatment of COVID-19 that are adequately powered to demonstrate efficacy or the absence of harm.
(22–24) In a study by Gautret et al., 6 of their 20 patients (there were 16 controls) on hydroxychloroquine (HCHQ) were prescribed azithromycin as well as prophylaxis for bacterial infection, and this appeared to enhance the activity of the HCHQ in terms of viral eradication, leading to a recommendation that they should be used together.
in France revealed that 100% of the patients who received a combination of HCQ plus azithromycin tested negative after 6 days of treatment (unpublished data).HCQ had shown higher in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and has been used in admitted COVID-19 patients on uncontrolled basis in many countries including USA.
13 The trial will compare four treatment options (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon beta-1a, and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) against the standard of care with the aim of rapidly determining whether any of the investigational therapeutics are effective against COVID-19.The quest for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent priority, and its development and global availability is a prerequisite for ending the COVID-19 pandemic.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine constitute candidate drugs against SARS-CoV infection and COVID-19 disease, and are now investigated for their therapeutic efficacy in international clinical trials with COVID-19 patients (i. e. SOLIDARITY Trial).The glycosylated S protein of SARS-CoV is highly immunogenic to the host immune system, and murine polyclonal antibodies against SARS-Co-V S protein potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell entry, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination [9] .
A series of clinical drugs and natural products with anti-viral, anti-bacterial and antiinflammatory effects exhibited high binding affinity to different target proteins, indicating their potential utility for treating SARS-CoV-2.We have identified a number of compounds that might have antiviral activity from the approved drugs library, such as anti-virus drugs (ribavirin, valganciclovir and thymidine), anti-bacterial drugs (cefpiramide, sulfasalazine, phenethicillin, lymecycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline, oxytetracycline and tigecycline), antiasthmatic drugs (montelukast, fenoterol and reproterol), and hepatoprotective drug silybin.
Together with the conserved R685 amino acid found in SARS-CoV-2 at the putative S1/S2 cleavage site, the insertion introduces a stretch of three basic arginine residues that could potentially be recognized by members of the pro-protein convertase family of proteases [35, 36] .
In a paper describing the first 12 patients with COVID-19 in the United States (U.S.), the three hospitalized patients, who received remdesivir at the time of clinical worsening, reported elevated liver enzymes [32].
Tocilizumab is available both IV as well as subcutaneously, while Sarilumab only subcutaneously, possibly limiting its usage due to the slower effect in an acute scenario as that of ARDS or pre-ARDS from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
However, ribavirin is readily excised from nascent RNA by nsp14, which may explain its limited efficacy in vivo 16 .Remdesivir is a promising drug candidate to treat COVID-19 infection [20] [21] [22] .
A large literature describes the immunosuppressive properties of several cannabinoids including Δ9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol and cannabinol [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .
Arbidol is a RNA synthesis inhibitor which is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of Influenza A and B, SARS, Hepatitis B and C, Herpies, Dengue Fever, and RSV.
In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) model is targeted by ribavirin after sequence analysis, modeling, and docking to build the model.
The WHO therefore seems to view chloroquine as experimental.
After 2015, regular dose reduction of imatinib (200mg per day) was started.
Eight different compounds are tested against Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp, including Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, Remdisivir, Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), Uracil triphosphate (UTP), Cinnamaldehyde, and Thymoquinone.
65 It has also been found that use of anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) improved outcomes in severe cases with coagulopathy.
Preliminary clinical data showed that hydroxychloroquine at 600 mg daily cured 70% of the patients (no=20) at day 6 after the first drug intake [8] .
Therefore, we further applied the MT-DTI model to repurpose those FDA-approved drugs that have the potential to inhibit key proteins of SARS-CoV-2.The SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase was predicted to bind with atazanavir (Kd 94.94 nM), followed by remdesivir, efavirenz, ritonavir, and other antiviral drugs that have a predicted affinity of Kd > 100 nM potency (Table 1) .
Various combinations of ribavirin, interferon, and other antiviral agents are currently being studied in several clinical trials.
Though a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of remdesivir in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is ongoing and results may be expected in April 2020, pre-clinical trials have shown significant activity against the coronavirus.
We found higher leptin levels in SARS-CoV-2 ventilated All rights reserved.
Since RBD of spike protein is surface-exposed and promotes entry into host cells, it could be a potential target for therapy and vaccination using small molecules and neutralizing antibodies to treat COVID-19 (4, 8) .In a recent study, we discovered that theaflavin possesses a potential chemical structure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (9) .
Magnetic bead capture and RT-LAMP amplification and testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, rapid, easy to use and to work equivalently to standard multiplex tandem PCR methods.
only in cells treated with arbidol, but not with the other five drugs, viral NP expression and CPE due to SARS-CoV-2 was substantially reduced.
For example, intravenous treatment of remdesivir has been reported to be helpful to improve the clinical condition for the first confirmed patient of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States, although the safety and efficacy are still needed to test in randomized controlled trials 4 .Nevertheless, there are many incoming or ongoing clinical studies in China, but no drug has been approved to be effective for COVID-19 so far.
In this study we analyzed particulate matter and ozone ambiental concentration in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infected cases from Italy and three other European countries, France, Germany and Spain.
25 However, COVID-19 patients treated with methylprednisolone were sicker and had a higher pneumonia severity index than those patients who did not receive methylprednisolone.
Interestingly, the majority of the immunogenic epitopes of the Nucleocapsid protein (13 out of 18) are located in the C-terminus of the protein, in the linker region and DD domain and right after Lysine 256 (see Fig.
[31] found patients taking arbidol and LPV/r (n=16) had increased SARS-CoV-2 negative rate in 7-days and 14-days, and improved chest CT scan compared to oral LPV/r (n=17) only.
3, 4, 7, 8 Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are believed to act on the entry and postentry stages of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 infection, likely via effects on endosomal pH and the resulting underglycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors that are required for viral entry.
In this context, our observations evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with tocilizumab is not achieved during hyperglycemia both in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
Azithromycin has also been used in combination with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 (31); the macrolide antibiotic can increase the risk of dysglycemia in people with diabetes mellitus (32) .Apart from worsening of hyperglycemia, a retrospective study from Wuhan reported that around 10% of the patients with T2DM and COVID-19 suffered at least one episode of hypoglycemia (<3.9 mmol/L) (33) .
Among these investigating drugs remdesivir showed promising results [18] [19] .

This is illustrated in the competition experiments, in which soluble heparin was able to completely abrogate the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to the surface (Figure 3A) .In a first set of competition experiments, immobilised 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was exposed to heparin or enoxaparin at the indicated concentration.
How can one reconcile these two inconsistent characteristics of the outbreak of COVID-19?
Herein, we report epidemiological information, clinical characteristics, therapeutic outcomes and the temporal progression of laboratory findings in COVID-19 patients exposed to lopinavir (LPV) for use in case management.
2 Among 99 cases with COVID-19 from Wuhan, 43 cases (43.4%) had increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactic dehydrogenase.
Teicoplanin specifically inhibits the entry of 2019-nCoV.
In 2020, such recommendation is more topical than ever with the emergence of COVID-19, especially since it results in fever, headaches, muscular pain, and cough, and is further complicated with pneumopathy, and given experimental data suggesting a link between ibuprofen and the level of expression of ACE2.
3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) is a cysteine protease present in the Coronavirus replicase polyprotein.
In vitro studies for SARS-CoV-2 also found chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a less-toxic derivative of chloroquine to be able to effectively inhibit viral growth (9) .
Position 614 in the Spike protein, where an Aspartate residue is found in high frequency in sequences obtained at the beginning of the pandemic.
She was isolated and treated empirically with the inhaled interferon α-1b (15 μg, bid), amoxicillin potassium clavulanate (30 mg/kg, q8h, intravenous glucose tolerance test [IVGTT]), reduced glutathione, ursodeoxycholic acid, and traditional Chinese medicine lotus qingwen.
Hence, baricitinib appears to be a potential kinase-inhibiting drug for the COVID-19.
62Patients with specific disorders that require the immediate administration of epinephrine (Table 1) Patients should inspect the epinephrine injectable devices to determine an expiration date and to 74 identify any potential issues associated with malfunction (see recent FDA communication) (8).
Detection frequency of these viruses in many studies is not different in the URT of asymptomatic controls and children hospitalized due to the respiratory tract infections, in contrast to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), and influenza, being causally associated with hospitalizations, lower respiratory symptoms, and pneumonia (Singleton et al., 2010, Sarna et al., 2018, Bhuiyan et al., 2019).
aprotinin or camostat) and antivirals provides a 537 promising approach to block SARS-CoV-2 replication that should be tested in cell cultures 538 and animal models and should furthermore be considered as therapeutic strategy for the 539 treatment of COVID-19.
Regarding current management of people with diabetes during this pandemic, Pal and Bhadada [2] have recently highlighted that the anti-malaria hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been used in the last weeks as a prophylaxis against COVID-19 in many countries; yet, in case of co-administration of HCQ together with other anti-diabetic drugs, the dosages of concomitant therapies may be reassessed, particularly in patients at higher hypoglycemic risk.
Colleges, universities, and cinema halls were soon to follow and were shut down within a week.
A non-randomized twenty patient study showed that hydroxychloroquine reduced viral load, but failed to correlate results with clinical outcomes, provided the basis for many centers' adoption of this experimental therapy [19] .
3 Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the local hospital, a randomized controlled trial was initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.
Recent publications suggest that similar to SARS-CoV, trypsin and TMPRSS2 also prime SARS-CoV-2 S protein for efficient infection 15, 37 .

7, 8 Hydroxychloroquine raises plasma vitamin D levels.
Finally, after being treated with high concentration of trypsin, 50.9% of the receptor-bound MHV S-e molecules underwent the final conformational change and transitioned to the post-fusion conformation (Fig 5F).
A meta-analysis from 32 studies of SARS coronavirus infection and severe influenza showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following CP therapy, compared with placebo or no therapy (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.45) (13) .
Oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu), is an antiviral medication for treating and preventing IAV that acts as an inhibitor of NA, thereby preventing the egress of new viral particles 39 .
While proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 are essential to mediate innate immunity, they can cause host damage as part of a maladaptive process.
Based on the initial data from Gautret and colleagues, 1 there has been a drastic increase in the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continues to rise.
In our study, ribavirin was empirically prescribed to all patients confirmed with COVID-19, whereas corticosteroids was rarely given.
Age below 40 or above 60 years old, male, higher Creatinine level, and lower platelet count also seemed related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, however the P values were greater than 0.05, which mean under the same condition studies of larger samples are needed in the future.
Overall, nearly 9.4% of critically ill patients admitted to the ICU with SARS-CoV-2 (55 out of 585 patients) had AKI; these results are summarized in Table 3.Taken together, these findings indicate that kidney function should be closely monitored when treating patients with COVID-19, particularly patients with preexisting CKD and/or abnormal serum creatinine levels, blood urea nitrogen levels, or relevant CT findings [22].
Validation studies further confirmed 30 known drugs to inhibit viral replication, including four molecules previously approved by the FDA (clofazimine, acitretin, tretinoin, and astemizole) or registered outside the US (tamibarotene).
Remdesivir at i+1 site can reduce nucleotide addition at the active site but cannot fully inhibit nucleotide addition.
One of the attractive antiviral drug targets is the SARS-CoV encoded cysteine protease -papain-like protease (PLpro) [6] .
Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the shortage of medical resources, many patients did not have a baseline serum creatinine test prior to admission, and had not had a creatinine test in the previous year.
It has been reported that the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir with ribavirin could lower the risk of ARDS compared with ribavirin alone [17].
2020) because of COVID-19 Outbreak in ItalyA major source of emissions of nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere is the combustion of fossil fuels from stationary sources (heating, power generation) and motor vehicles.
Furthermore, it was also granted by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine drug as an emergency as authorized for COVID-19 therapy.
Early interventions, including continuous renal replacement therapies, should be applied as early as possible to preserve kidney function in patients who show signs of kidney failure such as increased concentrations of urine protein, blood urea nitrogen, or plasma creatinine.
Considering that the patient became afebrile one day after receiving the anti-influenza drug, oseltamivir, her initial fever at the time of admission was presumably due to influenza.
While this EC50 for the MERS virus is higher than in previous studies [3], it does indicate that emetine is highly active against multiple coronaviruses.
S5B ).We then used the Huh-7 cell model in a 96 well format to test the effects of multiple drugs that have been approved by the FDA for other medical applications, including chloroquine, arbidol, toremifene, clomiphene, amodiaquine, verapamil, and amiodarone.

Despite SARS HCoV RdRp show slightly higher binding energies (lower in binding) compared to COVID-19 RdRp, the difference is still non-significant for Ribavirin, Remdisivir, Sofosbuvir and its parent nucleotide, UTP.
In the second phase of the transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, air pollution reduces intensity (on 7 th April, 2020 b' 1 = .81, p<0.001) also because of indirect effect of lockdown and human-to-human transmission does not change (b' 2 = 0.31, p<0.01): This result reveals that accelerated transmissions dynamics of COVID-19 is due to mainly to the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission in addition to human-to-human transmission.o To minimize future epidemics similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year in which Italian provincial capitals can exceed the limits set for PM 10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) or for ozone, considering their meteorological conditions, has to be less than 50 days.
24 To prevent misuse and hoarding, twenty two (22) states issued guidelines for pharmacists who are being allowed to "use their professional judgment when filling prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine" to ensure adequate supplies for patients with ongoing need for these medications for legitimate and/or pre-existing conditions such as lupus.
To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates the NAD system upon infection, we assembled and analyzed a set of 71 genes that encode the enzymes responsible for conversion of tryptophan, NA, NAM, and NR to NAD + , plus the enzymes responsible for NAD(H) phosphorylation, NADP(H) dephosphorylation, NAD + -dependent deacylation, ADPribosylation, cADP-ribose formation, nicotinamide methylation/oxidation, and other related functions in transport, binding, redox and regulation (Supplementary Information 1).
Production and supply chains for COVID-19 candidate drugs (such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), and for many other essential medical products, are being impaired by this crisis.
Umifenovir (Arbidol TM )Umifenovir [112] .
Second, lopinavir simply isn’t particularly potent against SARS-CoV-2.
In the past 10 years, LPV/r has been proven to have good efficacy and limited side effects for treating HIV-1 [7] .Lopinavir was reported to have antiviral activity against MERS-CoV in Vero cells (concentration causing a 50% reduction in replication (EC50) = 8 µM) [ 8 ] .Additionally, despite lacking a valid estimate of efficacy, the combination of LPV/r has been associated with significantly fewer adverse clinical outcomes (acute respiratory distress syndrome or death) in 41 patients with SARS compared with ribavirin alone in 111 historical controls (2.4% versus 28.8%, P= 0.001) in the 21 days after the onset of symptoms [ 9 ] .
9Multiple prospective, randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine are now underway and will, in due course, provide valuable information about safety and efficacy.
Potential therapeutic approaches include a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-based vaccine; a transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor to block the priming of the spike protein; blocking the surface ACE2 receptor by using anti-ACE2 antibody or peptides; and a soluble form of ACE2 which should slow viral entry into cells through competitively binding with SARS-CoV-2 and hence decrease viral spread as well as protecting the lung from injury through its unique enzymatic function.
In some patients, liver enzyme (transaminase), creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin increased.
In effect, the Wuhan Institute of Virology's first in vitro studies suggesting that both remdesivir and an antimalarial drug called chloroquine could effectively inhibit COVID-19 was published in early February 2020.
d) During COVID-19-infection a wide release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6 and TNF, has been observed, a phenomena that can be antagonized by colchicine.
Ivermectin reaching the lung after oral dosing is likely related to the unbound concentrations in plasma, the lipophilicity, and any transporters that may help maintain tissue distribution.
MMF was stopped and he currently continues with tacrolimus and prednisolone.
While the risk of retinopathy is a major limiting factor for chronic use at higher doses, this is likely to be less of a concern with acute short-term doses recommended for COVID-19, especially for HCQ that has a faster clearance from retinal pigment cells, compared to chloroquine.
We have noted that hydroxychloroquine has in vitro antiviral effects on several viruses, including SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 7-10 , which may contribute directly to its therapeutic effect to COVID-19 patients.
Moreover, Sofosbuvir has been already shown to be effective for other positive-sense RNA viruses, namely Yellow Fever and Hepatitis A virus [23, 24].
It is worth noting that, although the efficacy against human coronavirus (229E) is moderate, these compounds are the first benzimidazole derivatives to be found as active against this virus.
13, 14 Meanwhile, serum levels of some laboratory indexes such as total bilirubin, creatinine and hypersensitive troponin I were increased in patients on admission.
Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (59,63), and it may reduce the levels of VEGF caused by hypoxia, severe inflammation, and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract epithelium, all of which might suppress the edema in patients with COVID-19 (63).
In conclusion, we reported two false-negative results of rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection and mentioned the possible tandem approaches for clinical practices to ensure an early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.
La tabla 1 resume las interacciones de los fármacos antitrombóticos con los principales tratamientos utilizados contra el SARS-Cov-2.Los fármacos antirretrovirales como lopinavir/ritonavir son potentes inhibidores del citocromo CYP3A4, por lo que pueden aumentar la concentración de los anticoagulantes orales de acción directa (ACOD), fundamentalmente rivaroxabán y apixabán, así como de ticagrelor, lo que desaconseja su uso 14 .
Hence, other nucleoside analogues, such as favipiravir, ribavirin and galidesivir [56,64], may be potentially clinically applicable against SARS-CoV-2.
S7 ), a model of 2019-nCoV nsp12 with remdesivir diphosphate is proposed (Fig.

We prioritized several of these drugs based on potency or potential disease relevance, including the antipsychotic Haloperidol, which binds in the low nM range to both receptors 72 , and Chloroquine, which is currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 and has mid-nM activity vs the Sigma1 receptor, and low μM activity against the Sigma2 receptor.
The hepatic anicteric cholestasis and cytolysis of our patient was probably due to her transplant state, as no hepatitis during COVID-19 infection was described in the literature [14] .On the basis of this case, we suggest that liver transplantation is not associated with COVID-19 symptom severity and development, even when there is a high level of immunosuppression under tacrolimus treatment.
Nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin 12 may be potentially beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19, since ribavirin was approved for treating respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection 18 and used extensively during the SARS and MERS outbreak 10.

19An alternate mechanism hypothesized to inhibit the uptake of the virus into the host cell is based on the ability of chloroquine to be a broad inhibitor of nanoparticle endocytosis by resident macrophages.
Other clinically approvednucleoside/nucleotide analogues, such as the hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir and HIV drugsalovudine and zidovudine, have also been shown to be active against the SARS RdRp inin vitro biochemical assays and might have the potential to be repurposedagainst COVID-19.99 For a general review of nucleoside and nucleotideanalogues for cancer and viral diseases, including approved drugs and clinical candidates,please reference Jordheim et al.
The data have shown that 68% of severe patients have relieved symptoms after using remdesivir and the mortality of those patients is 13%, which is noteworthy though these findings need to be confirmed in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy for COVID-19 [9] .
Although older age and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease confer a higher risk for severe disease, young and otherwise healthy patients are also at risk for complications (19) .Common laboratory abnormalities found in patients with COVID-19 include lymphopenia (15) and elevation in lactate dehydrogenase and inflammatory markers such as, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (20) .
Recently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (EC50=5.47%µM, EC50=0.72%µM, respectively) [32, 43] .
However, the arbidol alone generated equivalent outcome in patients with COVID-19 compared with control group, while the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir showed better efficacy [27] .
To support this, they highlighted that aspirin did not affect coronavirus replication up to millimolar concentrations.
Among these, some hydrogen peroxide solutions, such as Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide, offer the advantage of potentially being less harmful to the user and equipment, while only requiring a short contact time of just a few minutes.
We acknowledge that these assessments and recommendations are fluid and may require modification as tocilizumab availability changes.

The SIMIT Lombardy section guidelines suggested tocilizumab in critically ill patients with ARDS [38].
Noteworthy, the author would like to stress that on the 9 th of March, 2020, nitazoxanide was previously suggested, among other drugs, by French colleagues to be evaluated for its potential against SARS CoV-2; unfortunately, their recommendation wasn't popular and has been practically ignored 22 .
Based on this mechanism of action, Gurwitz recently suggests ARBs (losartan and telmisartan) as a tentative therapy for COVID-19 patients prior to the development of ALI/acute respiratory failure.
Lastly, as tocilizumab attenuates the acute phase response, intestinal perforation may not necessarily cause significant C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation and may initially go unnoticed in sedated and ventilated patients.
At 21 °C and RH of 30-40%, inoculums of 103 plaque-forming units (PFU) of HuCoV-229E persisted on polyfluorotetraethylene (Teflon), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, and stainless steel for at least 5 d, as well as on silicon rubber for 3 d.

16 The patient was treated with IV ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, corticosteroids and levetiracetam.
Hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness profile, its ability to inhibit lung viral replication for a 10-day period after only a 5-day cycle of therapy, and the large amounts of knowledge in term of safety deriving from its use for malaria prophylaxis and rheumatologic diseases lead us to recommend its preexposure or postexposure use for those performing procedures at high risk of viral diffusion in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
Is high testosterone a promoter of COVID-19 infection?
Although the binding of SARS-CoV to sialic acids has not been reported so far (it is expected that Betacoronavirus adaptation to humans involves progressive loss of hemagglutinin-esterase lectin activity), if SARS-CoV-2 like other coronaviruses targets sialic acids on some cell subtypes, this interaction will be affected by chloroquine treatment [87 , 88] .

Question 6Should other immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulatory therapies be administered?Owing to the lack of high-level evidence, administration of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 should preferentially occur within the framework of RCT.
Last but not least, altered leptin sensitivity in obese patients may, in combination with a viral infection, contribute to an excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine response and to a less effective response to infection 10 .Based these clinical observations we hypothesized that leptin may plays a pivotal role in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 symptoms.
Unfortunately, if there is any acute, tenacious or dormant form of viral infection inside the CNS, its immune system does not react subsequently, which results in neurological disorders.
After suspension of fingolimod, she developed CRS and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was successfully treated with tocilizumab.
reported that chloroquine prevented the spread of the SARS coronavirus in cell culture by interfering with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.
Regarding the latter, no SARS-CoV-2-specific drugs are currently available and, as a consequence, there is the need for repurposing drugs used in other settings, such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 2, 3 .

According to this hypothesis, we checked the expression of the gene in lungs of men and females at different ages, but no substantial differences emerged between males and females (neither below, nor above 60 years of age; data not shown).Finally, we explored genetic variation in TMPRSS2 in search of variants, possibly already annotated as eQTL in the lung, which might have an impact on the serine protease expression as well as on its catalytic activity.
First, abiraterone, approved for hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer, is always used in combination with prednisone for several months, often in elderly patients; the mechanisms that underlie the immunosuppressive properties of glucocorticoids have been well recognized and described [3] .Second, enzalutamide, approved for the same indications as abiraterone and commonly used without concomitant steroids, induces a significant rise in cortisol concentration and cortisol/cortisone ratio, so it equally causes immunosuppression.
Chloroquine phosphate competes with the porphyrin and binds to the viral protein, thereby inhibits the viral protein’s attack on heme or binding to the porphyrin.
Clinical trials are also required to explore whether tocilizumab can be used effectively in patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and to investigate at what stage of the disease this treatment could be the most appropriate.

There is also data that chloroquine interferes with organelle acidification, which may lead to hindering fusion of viral particles, when chloroquine treatment was used for different emerging or non-emerging virus over the previous five decades: Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-3) [35], Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [36], or H5N1 strain of Influenza A [37].3.Reduction of viral infectivity: Chloroquine inhibits viral particle glycosylation [38].
To our surprise, we found that, even without trypsin, SARS-CoV-2 S protein could trigger syncytium formation on 293/hACE2 cells, a phenomena similar to what was observed in MHV S protein in certain aspect51.
Drugs like azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine can cause QT prolongation and potentially lifethreatening arrhythmias.
[24]Other TherapiesOther treatment options, which are either used rarely or in experimental state, are SiRNA, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, pentoxifylline, etc., However, the level of evidence is quite poor and hence not recommended for routine care.
1 The safety advantage for novel oral anticoagulants over warfarin may be even larger during the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof COVID-19 pandemic, because it will be challenging for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation who take warfarin to receive regular blood tests to monitor international normalized ratios, and therefore it may be prudent to prescribe novel oral anticoagulants instead of warfarin to stroke patients with atrial fibrillation during this crisis period.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily relies on the serine protease TMPRSS2 but can also utilize an alternate pathway involving Cathepsin B/L in TMPRSS2-negative cells 6 .
5Hypothesis:That Vitamin D deficiency might play a role in the variation in severity of COVID-19, such that treatment with Vitamin D would offer a simpler alternative to tocilizumab.
Treatment with intravenous remdesivir showed significant improvement for the first COVID-19 case in US [24] and then a trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with 2019-nCoV infection.
c) SARS-CoV-2 may use microtubules for replication machinery for instance in the formation of double-membrane, colchicine is an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation.
Since the current 2019 outbreak, researchers have built upon this knowledge to assess whether or not chloroquine may inhibit SARS-CoV-2.
Des informations régulièrement mises à jour peuvent donc être recensées à partir de ce site et nous proposons ci-après un focus réalisé sur les seules thérapeutiques évoquées précédemment et disponibles sur ce site (lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) avec uniquement les psychotropes commercialisés en France (ou en ATU).Ces données permettent de mettre en exergue les principales associations à proscrire :• la carbamazépine ne doit pas être associée à la chloroquine ou l'hydroxychloroquine, en raison du risque de perte d'efficacité des traitements anti-SARS-CoV-2 (induction enzymatique puissante) ; • la ziprasidone (ATU) ne doit être associée à aucun de ces traitements en raison du risque cardiologique et d'augmentation des concentrations plasmatique de l'antipsychotique avec l'association lopinavir/ritonavir ; • le pimozide et la quétiapine ne doivent pas être co-administrées avec l'association lopinavir/ritonavir en raison du risque cardiologique et d'augmentation des concentrations plasmatique des antipsychotiques ; • le midazolam par voie orale (indication dans l'épilepsie de 3 mois à 18 ans) ne doit pas être combiné au lopinavir/ritonavir compte tenu du risque d'augmentation des concentrations plasmatiques de la benzodiazépine ; • pour un traitement enfin, en apparence plus anecdotique, et relevant souvent de l'automédication, le millepertuis ne doit être utilisé avec aucun de ces médicaments, en raison du risque de diminution d'efficacité des traitements dirigés contre le SARS-COV-2 (induction enzymatique puissante).Notons que les auteurs à l'origine de cette base de données peuvent être contactés afin d'intégrer des traitements non listés (l'AFPBN a formulé une demande auprès du site pour l'intégration de la cyamémazine et de la tropatépine ; substances les plus prescrites par la psychiatrie hospitalière franç aise [24] ).

According to this guideline, two patients in the study were given chloroquine for antiviral therapy.
Although rates of heart failure have been infrequently reported in epidemiologic reports from China to date, the prevalence of heart failure among critically ill patients with Covid-19 in the United States may be high (>40%).59 In the Quinapril Heart Failure Trial, among patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure, withdrawal of quinapril resulted in a progressive decline in clinical status.
Thus, as alternative 24 potentially more direct "broad-spectrum" COVID-19 therapeutics, several natural and synthetic PAK1-blockers such 25 as propolis, melatonin, ciclesonide, hydroxy chloroquine (HQ), ivermection, and ketorolac, which are readily available 26 in the market, are introduced here.
In the program CHIMERA (76) , we utilized the rotamer function to model each individual variant that species exhibit separately, and chose the rotamer with the least number of clashes, retaining the most initial hydrogen bonds and containing the highest probability of formation as calculated by CHIMERA from the Dunbrack 2010 backbone-dependent rotamer library (77) .

Instead, variants have a stretch of 4 Phenylalanine, which should increase hydrophobicity of this regions.
Phenylalanine (F) commonly immediately precedes many of these matching subsequences NCYFP… NCYWP… etc., and the conservative substitution tryptophan (W) substitution for the second phenylalanine (F) is also very common, so it may be worth noting that FNCTWP is a subsequence in the mammalian vomeronasal type-2 receptor 1 on sensory cells within the main nasal chamber that detects heavy moistureborne odor particles, and FNCTWP is also found in in dynein.
Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 is only expressed on TROP2 high cholangiocytebiased progenitors while serine protease TMPRSS2 is expressed by TROP2 high and TROP2 int population.

In fact, some studies have shown that povidone iodine effectively reduces the number of droplets and aerosols produced during oral operations.
Certainly Ivermectin therefore warrants further investigation for possible benefits in humans.
Therefore, our findings imply that the development of COVID-19 may cause hepatic impairment in these patients, which is consistent with the observations that a large number of COVID-19 patients showed liver function abnormalities (Table S13 ) (6) .Besides, the reductions of dihydrouracil, an intermediate breakdown product of uracil and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) (29) , are proposed to be caused by the defects of human metabolism.

Le risque de confusion, qui peut être induit par les traitements sédatifs, est également bien identifié avec les traitements anticholinergiques, surtout chez les personnes âgées et incite, comme nous l'avons exposé précédemment, à identifier ces traitements, évaluer la charge anticholinergique supportée par les patients, et éventuellement réévaluer les posologies et la nature des traitements proposés [21, 24] .La réévaluation des traitements sédatifs et anticholinergiques chez les patients touchés par le SARS-CoV-2, et présentant une fatigue et/ou une confusion, est particulièrement indiquée chez les sujets âgés en raison de leur grande sensibilité à ces effets qui les exposent à leurs conséquences délétères (notamment les chutes) et ce, encore davantage dans une situation d'offre de soins limitée.
Almost three-fourth (70.5%) respondents felt that COVID-19 could cause macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and Tocilizumab was the preferred drug for treatment (27.6%).
These results are of great importance because a recent paper has shown that the mean duration of viral shedding in patients suffering from COVID-19 in China was 20 days (even 37 days for the longest duration) [19] Very recently, a Chinese team published results of a study demonstrating that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72%µM) found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47%µM) [14] .
In addition to its immunomodulant and antiinflammatory effect, chloroquine increases endosomal pH and interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV, thereby blocking viral infection (69) .
Baricitinib

The recent data on the compassionate use of remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19 indicated that clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%) 3 .
Although chloroquine was reported to be active against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in vitro [46] , this observation remains controversial [47] .
Because both viruses are RNA virus depending on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate, the RdRp inhibitor Arbidol (common name for Umifenovir) approved for influenza in Russia and China has been proposed as a standard care option for COVID-19, mainly based on its mechanism-of-action (MoA) and its effects in treating influenza-associated pneumonia.
Unfractionated heparin has the advantages of a short half-life, a convenient monitoring process and the fact that it can be neutralized with protamine.
As the majority of our patients (22/33) was treated with tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including those developing severe or critical disease, our cohort data indicate no or only minimal clinical effect of tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2.There is no doubt that our study has important limitations.

However, further multivariate analysis was performed based on these variables and showed that with the symptoms of muscle ache(P=0.002), shortness of breath(P=0.002), nausea and vomiting(P=0.001), combined with higher serum creatinine level (P=0.004) and lower lymphocytes levels (P=0.008) and accompanied with higher total radiograph score were the possible predictive factors for severe/critical subtype( shown in Table 5 )DiscussionThe recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has caused an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in patients in Wuhan.
Next, we propagated the uncertainty in the estimated number of imported COVID-19 cases from Wuhan, and estimated the probability that a local outbreak would occur and sustain for at least three generations (hereinafter referred to as "local outbreak risk") for each country or territory outside mainland China.
Antiviral therapy consisting of oseltamivir, ganciclovir and lopinavir-ritonavir was given to 75% of the patients.
A study is now under way recruiting hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 (NCT04315298) using the anti-IL-6 agent sarilumab, whereas 3 other studies are evaluating tocilizumab alone: COVACTA (NCT04320615) and TOCOVID (NCT04322773), or in combination with favipiravir (NCT04310228) as well in the NIHR RECOVERY trial as part of the second randomization arm.
Our docking results show that remdesivir-TP binds to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with a score of -112.8, and the docking results are consistent with its original anti-viral mechanism, so we think remdesivir may be good in treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
In conclusion, Nilotinib seems to be an anti-inflammatory agent with a good infective safe profile; these features could make it, in our opinion, a good candidate in the COVID-19 setting; nevertheless, we have to consider its high rate of cardiovascular complications seen in CML [76, 77] that could be the consequence of the inflammatory endothelial damage, as shown by higher IL6 and lower IL10 levels in CML patients presenting cardiovascular events [78] .
It is an important topic to explore how antibody tests can be most eectively used in tandem with PCR tests leading to the largest possible testing capacity.
Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index; gastrointestinal disturbance may be seen in up to 10% of patients possibly limiting its usage in COVID-19 due to the relatively frequent occurrence of diarrhea in these patients.
Coagulation function disorders were reported in most of the severe COVID-19 patients, by elevated levels of D-Dimer and prolonged prothrombin time, some of whom ended in disseminated intravascular coagulation Huang et al., 2020; .

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg given twice daily for 1 day, followed by 200 mg twice daily for another 4 days is recommended in the treatment COVID-19 [43].
15 An evolving body of literature suggests COVID-19 incidence and outcomes vary according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying health status, with inconsistent evidence suggesting that commonly used medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazolidinediones (TZD), and ibuprofen may alter the natural disease course(3-9).
Likewise, trypsin was also found to induce MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein mediated cell-cell fusion of Vero E6 cells and 293T cells, respectively (Ou et al., 2020; Shirato et al., 2013).
Therapy (IVIG, anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6)Due to the very rapid distribution of scientific knowledge today, several optional therapies have been already suggested in a small study scales to be beneficial such as the application of chloroquine (plaquenil), remdesivir and others [3] .

We speculate that with the further development of infection, amylase may enter peripheral blood after acinar cell destruction.
Thereafter the antiviral activity was assessed following continuous exposure to serial dilutions of ivermectin, which caused concentration-dependent antiviral effects with practically total eradication at 5 µmol/L and halfmaximal inhibition at approximately 2.5 µmol/L 11 .The academic, virological and pharmacological impact of the newly discovered antiviral effects of ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2 is beyond any doubt, but nevertheless the notion for possible clinical translation and repurposing, which has generated enormous media coverage, needs to be carefully addressed with reference to the pharmacokinetics of ivermectin.
In the two patients with ocrelizumab, both had relatives infected at home.
Another antiviral drug, Remdesivir, which has been used for treating Ebola virus infections has also been under investigation for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections [25], and can block viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 even at a very low concentrations [19].
But other clinical trials did not support the use of hydroxychloroquine, particularly in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypoxic pneumonia or severe COVID-19 cases.

Serine protease inhibitor camostat blocked SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells in a dose-dependent manner 15 , making it and other similar inhibitors such as nafamostat 39 and Pharos compounds (CHEMBL1229259) candidate small-molecule inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19 patients (Fig.
Since SARS-CoV-2 also binds to the same ACE2 receptor as SARS-CoV 5 and SARS-CoV-2 is also susceptible to the inhibitory effect of chloroquine (CQ), a lysosomotropic agent 43, it is highly possible that this new CoV utilizes the same endocytic pathway for entry into the host cells.
Recently, chloroquine was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its hydroxylated form has been proposed as a possible therapy to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [4 , 5] .
1 However, randomised clinical trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19.Convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins have been used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients with SARS whose condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment with pulsed methylprednisolone.
Experience with immunotherapy-triggered CRS suggests that tocilizumab is indicated only for severe cases, while the risk benefit assessment favors symptomatic management for mild cases [10] .
Another anti-HIV drug, Prezcobix of Johnson & Johnson, which consists of darunavir and cobicistat, was to be sent to China (16) , and darunavir is also predicted to have a Kd of 90.38 nM against 2019-nCoV's helicase (Table 3) .
(23) The correction of hypokalaemia can be challenging due to continuous renal loss of potassium resulting from the degradation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 by binding of SAR-CoV-2.
How does the adrenal cortex function react in this critical situation?
Following 2 h of incubation, the inoculum was removed, and the cells were covered with agar/basic medium mixture, which contained 0.8% agar and indicated concentrations of LS or Remdesivir.
These results evidence that these compounds could be suitable for further medicinal chemistry optimization to produce the second generation of inhibitors more specific and potent against SARS-CoV-2.Other antivirals have been evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 as the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, a nucleotide analog (currently in clinical trials against Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2), alone or in combination with chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosome acidification, with interesting results (Wang et al., 2020[18]; de Wit et al., 2020[2]).
Hence, lower dose and short duration of corticosteroids treatment (methylprednisolone, <1 mg/kg body weight, no more than 7 days), along with adverse drug reaction monitoring, would be more beneficial in clinical management of critical patients with 2019-nCoV.
Patients in the experimental group received an initial dose of 200 mg of remdesivir followed by a daily dose of 100 mg of remdesivir through intravenous infusion in addition to standard of care therapy, whereas patients in the control group received standard of care therapy and the same dose of a RDV placebo according to the clinical trial data from U.S National Library of Medicine (2020) [64] .

In animal models, compared with lopinavir plus ritonavir combined with interferon beta, two other potential candidates, remdesivir more significantly reduced the virus titre of mice infected with the MERS-CoV and decreased the lung tissue damage.
Already in patients with SARS-CoV, the development of respiratory failure was thought to be the consequence of a vigorous innate immune response, while effectiveness of tocilizumab in COVID-19 infected patients also supports the participation of a cytokine storm in severe phenotypes 1,2 .
If hydroxychloroquine is found to be the silver bullet for COVID-19, then this may be a big challenge in treating COVID-19 in G6PD-deficient patients.
Chloroquine has also been found to have some immunomodulatory effects through the suppression of Tumor Necrosis Factor-and IL-6 release, which may help prevent the cytokine storm that leads to rapid deterioration of patients with COVID-19 (1, 22) .
Other drugs proposed for therapy are arbidol (an antiviral drug available in Russia and China), intravenous immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine and plasma of patients recovered from COVID-19 [21, 28, 29].

30.20047878 doi: medRxiv preprint is also promoted by estrogens, 11 and therefore the situation might be different when considering individuals above 60 years, who are at higher risk of fatal events due to COVID-19, as in this group women will all be postmenopausal.
France already had 1 death case in February and was the slowest to react nationwide.
Optimal dosing and duration of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 are unknown.
", here I am referring to the drugs that are listed earlier (Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir), and not the chemical compounds (IDX-184, Setrobuvir, and YAK).I would believe that everyone agrees that although computers would not solely treat any disease, yet they can help save lives by accelerating the drug design step for combating the emerging pandemic COVID-19.
hydroxychloroquine is that results regarding efficacy in treating SARS-Cov-2 has been conflicting.
Remdesivir ::: ANTIVIRAL TREATMENTSRemdesivir (RDV), a nucleoside analog GS‐5734, had been reported to inhibit human and zoonotic coronavirus in vitro and to restrain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in vivo.
Although the molecular mechanism underlying the action of Chloroquine remains to be defined, it is envisioned that in addition to directly affecting the endosomal viral entry and release via inhibiting endosomal function, Chloroquine may potentially affect the viral assembly at the ERGIC and/or viral release from the TGN indirectly.
Intramuscular administration of emetine can also result in nausea and vomiting [12] which, based on studies with ipecac syrup [10], are likely to be negated with the concomitant use of a 5-HT3 antagonist.
Invitro studies have suggested that chloroquine, an immunomodulant drug traditionally used to treat malaria, is effective in reducing viral replication in other infections, including the SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV) and MERS-CoV [2] [3] [4] .Chloroquine has been used worldwide for more than 70 years, and it is part of the World Health Organization (WHO) model list of essential medicines.
Some patients have an elevated lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine kinase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase.
Therefore, Lei Fang and colleagues have speculated that this could be related to the use of drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazolidinediones, or ibuprofen, which cause an increase in the cellular expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), that has been recognized as the target to which the virus bind to cells, and suggest a treatment adjustment to modulate ACE2 expression, using the antihypertensive calcium channel blockers as alternative (2) .Although this hypothesis is possible, the association between such comorbidities and the development of severe and fatal COVID-19 may have other explanations.
Next-generation sequencing identified that an amino acid substitution at A25V (C19647T in the reference sequence NC_019843.3) in nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15), coronavirus endoribonuclease (6-8), was the predicted mechanism for viral resistance to ciclesonide.
In vitro analyses in Vero cells demonstrated that the potency of hydroxychloroquine (EC50 of 0.72 µM) was greater than that of chloroquine (EC50 of 5.47 µM) against SARS-CoV-2 [18].
Oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and umifenovir were common antiviral drugs used in our treatment protocols.
Baricitinib, for example, is a rheumatological drug currently in trial for COVID-19 and all diffusion-based pipelines rank it higher than tocilizumab, a drug also indicated for rheumatological and severe inflammatory diseases with no proven COVID-19 relevance.
This makes the virus able to interact with high airways and then reach the low airway cells [38] .The recognition between spike and sialic acids occurs via a conserved groove which plays a key role for S MERS-CoV-mediated attachment to sialosides and entry into human airway epithelial cells [33] .Since the interaction of MERS-CoV spike and the sialic acids is caused mainly by hydrogen bonds and shape complementarity [39] , our method is particularly suitable to find on the SARS-CoV-2 spike surface a region similar to the one involved in binding of the sialic acid in MERS-CoV spike.
In conclusion, we have provided evidence of a beneficial effect of co-administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early reduction of contagiousness.
The collective mentality that we are all in this together was challenging when the COVID-19 pandemic began and might prove as equally difficult to sustain after it is over.

Before discussing the MD results, a quick scan on the physical changes at some of these mutations can already be made:• Y to L455: this mutation in SARS-CoV-2 leads to the loss of the aromatic ring and especially the hydroxyl group of Tyrosine amino acid.
Besides, chloroquine phosphate was reported to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 in a multicenter clinical trials 21 and had just been included in the latest edition of the guidelines for China.
The role of preparing the nasal and oral cavity with a 0.5% solution of povidone iodine on pledgets for its virocidal properties towards SARS-CoV-2 is unknown at this point in time [24] [25] [26] [27] but is considered an option at our institution.
[12] A prominent national regulatory body has issued an advisory favouring prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine for healthcare workers and close contacts of patients with COVID-19 [13] However, caution is needed as reports of toxicity have emerged with the use of prophylaxis.
Prazosin is inexpensive and safe, as has been documented by long-term treatment of millions of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension, and other conditions.
Treatment by patisiran for familial amyloid neuropathy (FAP)It is recommended to interrupt the delivery of patisiran infusions in the hospital to avoid exposing these patients to the risk of COVID-19 contamination in the hospital environment as these individuals are considered to be at high risk for serious complications (e.g., due to age of older than 70 years and underlying cardiomyopathies) with a relay conducted by infusions performed at home.
Sodium hypochlorite required a concentration of at least 0.21% to be effective.
Although the latter precludes definitive conclusions, comparisons with contemporaneous cohorts from the literature, in whom general care is expected to be consistent with that of our cohort, suggest that remdesivir may have clinical benefit in patients with severe Covid-19.

Even though chloroquine derivates are not approved treatments for COVID-19, President Trump has tweeted and publicly suggested the therapeutic benefit of the drugs.
The Surviving Sepsis guidelines specifically suggested against the routine use of lopinavir-ritonavir, convalescent plasma and intravenous immunoglobulins in critically ill COVID-19 patients (weak recommendation), and stated there was insufficient evidence to issue recommendations on the use of other anti-viral agents, recombinant interferons, chloroquine/HCQ or tocilizumab in critically ill COVID-19 patients [35].
5 In fact, due to off-label prescriptions and hoarding, hydroxychloroquine is now difficult to obtain for patients without COVID-19 who need this drug to manage rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders.
Upon admission, laboratory examination showed a platelet count of 402 × 10 9 /L (reference range, 100-300 × 10 9 /L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 34 mm/h (0-15 mm/h), uric acid concentration of 414.50 µmol/L (142-339 µmol/L), procalcitonin concentration of <0.02 (0.00-0.05 ng/mL), alanine aminotransferase concentration of 15 U/L (0-38 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase concentration of 18.2 U/L (0-38 U/L), total protein concentration of 57.9 g/L (62-85 g/L), and globulin concentration of 21.2 g/L (25-45 g/L).

Then, expert recommendations are rapidly assessing potential therapeutical drugs that may help in the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including chloroquine, as currently reported in many emerging interim guidelines [9–12].
In this context and according to our postulated model, HEAT can be considered as a pro-drug as well as suicide drug which binds first to the active site of M pro , where it is cleaved in an E1cB-like reaction mechanism into 2methylene-1-tetralone and tyramine.
Remdesivir has been reported to treat the first US case of COVID-19 successfully [77].
Some clinical trials, it has been described that anti-HIV drugs and chloroquine phosphate, an anti-malarial drug, has a assured therapeutic effect on the COVID-19.
It was strengthened by evidence that remdesivir was successful in both preventing and controlling MERS-CoV-induced clinical disease in nonhuman primates [33].
A single arm study of 20 COVID-19-positive patients treated in France demonstrated some efficacy for the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, a safer variation of chloroquine, in SARS-CoV-2 [80].

A chemically modified heparin derivative with the predominant repeating disaccharide structure; IdoA-GlNAc,6S, was able to induce closely comparable secondary structural changes in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD as heparin (Figure 5, A -C) .
For example, information about the possible effectiveness of some treatments could be considered as rumors at a given point in time, in absence of definitive scientific consensus; yet, as more clinical evidence emerges, these may become false claims, hence classified as misinformation: one such example is Hydroxychloroquine, a known anti-malaria drug whose effectiveness in treating SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 disease) remains debated at this point in time, and whose potentially lethal side-effects limit large-scale testing.
In fact, even if the efficacy of HCQ is confirmed, the world will be facing a new issue for both COVID-19 and rheumatic disorders patients: "Shortage of Hydroxychloroquine".In this case, we carried out the present systematic review in order to reach at a clear result regarding taking or not-taking HCQ.

Why hydroxychloroquine might be efficacious in COVID-19It has been demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters ACE2-expressing cells including alveolar epithelial cells of the lung and in other organs (28) (29) (30) , which has been shown before also for SARS-CoV-1.
DesignWe undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating IL-6 dysregulation in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and the potential role of IL-6 suppression with the administration of tocilizumab.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this delayed termination induced by remdesivir remain largely elusive.
Antiviral agents and methylprednisolone were also administered.
Because the world is threatened by the possibility of a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the broad-spectrum antiviral effects of chloroquine warranted particular attention for repurposing this drug in the therapy of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Baricitinib ::: Recent Advances in the Treatment of 2019-Novel CoronavirusThe SARSCoV and the 2019nCoV both enters host cells through ACE2 receptormediated entry, especially through AT2 cells present in lungs.
If applied to treat Covid-19, the drug eflornithine should bind to similar sites on the surface of Covid-19 proteins (hydrophobic and thermodynamically active).The analysis of the contact patterns between the ACE2 receptor and the spike glycoprotein's receptor binding domain (RBD) (Figure 4 ) in both SARS (pdb id 6cs2) and Covid-19 (pdb id 6m0j) reveals a significant difference in the distribution of binging important residues between the two viruses.
Another study tried treating 75 patients twice a day with the oral administration of 75 mg oseltamivir, 500 mg lopinavir, 500 mg ritonavir, and intravenous (IV) 0.25 g ganciclovir for three to 14 days [41].
In the past medical history, the patient was a well-known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus and was treated with metformin medication.
Chloroquine was discovered by Hans Andersag in 1934.
RDV is an adenosine nucleotide analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, which acts as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps).8 RDV inhibits viral replication through premature termination of RNA transcription and has been demonstrated to improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads in mice infected with MERS-CoV.9 A recent in vitro study indicated that RDV potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 (EC50 = 0.77 μM) in Vero E6 cells.
Odds ratio (OR) for poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients was analyzed with multivariate logistic regression adjusted for selected confounders: age, gender, comorbidity, body temperature, number of pulmonary lobe involved, leukocyte count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein level, IL-6 level, and IL-10 level on admission.
These results provide information that can be essential when the use of chloroquine is considered for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
Two of these trials are estimated to complete in May 2020.Favipiravir (FPV) is a guanine analogue that selectively inhibits RdRP of RNA viruses and has been approved for the treatment of novel influenza since 2014.12In vitro study showed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by favipiravir (EC50= 61.88 μM in Vero E6 cells).10 Cai et al conducted an open label, controlled study to examine the effects of FPV (1600 mg twice daily on day 1 and 600 mg twice daily on days 2-14) versus LPV/RTV (400 mg/100 mg twice daily) in addition to interferon-α1b 60 mg twice daily by inhalation for the treatment of COVID-19.
Most of these suggestions are based on in vitro studies, virtual screenings and records of their effects on SARS and MERS.In addition to these medications, Tocilizumab has recently been suggested as a COVID-19 treatment.
With an established safety profile for anti-parasitic use, the next step to prove Ivermectin’s efficacy on treating COVID-19 involves trials to figure out the adequate dosing.
Inflammation is thought to underpin severe COVID-19, as laboratory in-vestigations have also found elevated plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) in severe COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020) .
Pharmacological, therapeutic, and toxicological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquineGeneral aspects to be considered for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 using CQ and HCQ are summarized in Figure 1.

Arbidol, a small indole derivative molecule, was found to block viral fusion against influenza A and B viruses and hepatitis C viruses [48] and confirmed to have antiviral effect on SARS-CoV in cell experiment [49] , so that it might be a choice for COVID-19 treatment.
Type II transmembrane serine proteases are likely targets for cleavage activation of 2019-nCoV based on studies of SARS-CoV, but they still require clarification as to the natural sequences typically cleaved, and as discussed in Section 4.7, the relation between KRSFIEDLLFNKV from 2019-nCoV and a model substrate sequence for type II transmembrane serine proteases, AEAALRKLLEVA, is probably not significant.
46 The concomitant increase in other inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., D-dimer, ferritin, and interleukin-6) implies that the rise in high-sensitivity troponin I is more reflective of cytokine storm or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis than isolated cardiac injury.
Then, several randomized clinical trials were initiated in China and more recently in Italy, investigating different treatment options, varying from classical antiviral drugs as lopinavir/ritonavir, to newer antiviral as remdesivir, to unconventional agents such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [19].
Meanwhile, sarilumab, which is another IL-6 receptor antagonist, has also launched phase II/III clinical trial to evaluate its efficacy in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (NCT04315298).
However, six of the 10 transplant patients in our study had elevated serum creatinine.
CVL218 inhibits IL-6 production in PBMCs induced by CpG-ODN 1826Recently it has become evident that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the most important cytokines during viral infection [19] , and emerging clinical studies in humans and animals have linked the excessive synthesis of IL-6 with the persistence of many viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [20] , foot and mouth disease virus [21] and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [22] .
In the present study, our systematic results of cure rate of drug for MERS-COV infection indicated that ribavirin and interferon, oseltamivir, antivirals and intravenous immunoglobulin all had been effective for MERS-COV infection, with the cure rate of those drugs was 74.2%, 69.2%, 67.1% and 62.5% respectively.
46Antiviral and Antimalarial Agents ::: TherapeuticsLopinavir and ritonavir are HIV protease inhibitors that demonstrated antiviral effects in vitro against SARS-CoV (Figure 5A) and decreased viral loads in nonhuman primates infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (Figure 5B).54,55,80 An open-label randomized controlled trial, however, did not show efficacy in patients with COVID-19 (Figure 5C).56 Remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue initially developed for Ebola, was also effective against SARS/Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV in vitro and in murine and nonhuman primate models.
6, 7 Moreover, in vitro experiments have shown that mutations conferring resistance to remdesivir do not easily emerge in coronaviruses 8 .
This combination was recently associated to worse outcomes when Hydroxychloroquine was administrated at high doses (QTc elongation and higher rates of lethality) [17] .Thus, there is not an effective nor safe medication for the management of COVID-19.Given the lack of evidence for treatment of COVID-19 and vaccines, classical and historical interventions have remerged as options for the control of disease.
o There is reluctance to initiate biological DMARDs (especially Rituximab and anti-TNF agents), tsDMARDs (JAK inhibitors) and cyclophosphamide.o There is an inclination to prescribe hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) even for rheumatic diseases with weak level of evidence.
All assays are based on inhibition of proteins of SARS-CoV-1.Selecting bioassays for multiple targets of SARS-CoV.The SARS-CoV-2 has two main proteases that are critical for its replication, namely the 3CLpro (3C-like protease) and PLpro (Papain Like Protease), encoded in an open reading frame (Macchiagodena et al., 2020) .
The latest version (6th edition) of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China has recommended a combination regimen of protease inhibitors (lopinavir and ritonavir) with INF-α.
32 In non-ICU patients, a progressive PLT decrease is rarely occurred, either because of the less severe viral and secondary bacterial infection or the far lower level of heparin exposure, since heparin was primarily administered for flushing the central venous catheter but not for prevention blood clots and treatment of venous thrombosis in ICU patients.
With regards to COVID-19, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been identified as possible therapeutic agents potentially useful in combating COVID-19.

It is possible that a combo therapy including Oseltamivir can help this subgroup of patients due to the effectiveness of Oseltamivir in treating severe illness caused by Influenza.
In this regard, we may think that it is unfortunate to be forced to treat selected clinically stable patients with temporary hypoxemia (silent hypoxemia) using invasive MV to decrease their initial venous admixture, when instead we could potentially treat them by decreasing transpulmonary blood flow (almitrine, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), reverse Trendelenburg positioning, fluid depletion…).Indeed, in-hospital mortality reported from Wuhan was very high among patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom between 62% and 97% of patients died (8) .The present message highlights that the mortality is very high among patients with severe SRAS-CoV-2 pneumonia who are under or requiring MV (8) .
On the one hand, gastrointestinal function decline or gastrointestinal mucosal cell integrity and barrier function is impaired, resulting in a reduction in phosphorus intake from food.
By conjugating the cholesterol molecule to the EK1 peptide, we found that one of the lipopeptides, EK1C4, exhibited highly potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, about 240- and 150-fold more potent than EK1 peptide, respectively.

Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity 1 , including against coronaviruses 2 , that is currently investigated in COVID-19 clinical trials worldwide, including in China, the US and Europe (summarized in 3 ).
Interestingly, the levels of serum biomarkers reflecting glomerular filtration function (including cystatin C (CysC), creatinine (CREA), and urea) in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild patients.
In this regard, since coronaviruses are a family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses with conserved polymerase, SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is very likely to be effectively inhibited by sofosbuvir.
Currently, the use of remdesivir is restricted to controlled clinical trials, although it is also available through an expanded access program and a compassionate use program for individuals who are not eligible to participate in controlled clinical trials.
We must therefore anticipate conditions that will prevail at the resumption of surgical activity and determine which parameters will allow such resumption in good safety conditions: a reduction in COVID-19 linked hospitalizations, clearly established circuits for treating COVID-19-patients, the exclusive use of single rooms, and the absence of infection in admitted patients and nursing staff, confirmed by systematic and reliable diagnostic tests which may consist of a PCR, or serology to determine immunity when it becomes available for routine use, and/or a thoracic CT.

Furthermore, nafamostat mesylate blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells with an EC50 around 10 nM, which is below its average blood concentration after intravenous administration through continuous infusion.
The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 seems stronger than SARS-CoV, with alterations in several amino acid residues allowing for enhanced hydrophobic interactions and salt bridge formations, which may explain the considerably larger global influence of COVID-19 than the initial SARS.16,42 Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to utilize a wide array of host proteases including cathepsin L, cathepsin B, trypsin, factor X, elastase, furin, and TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) for S-protein priming and facilitating cell entry following receptor binding.
Here we review the literature on an existing but not approved antiviral agent, remdesivir, which exhibits promising in vitro antiviral activity and preliminary clinical experiences in the treatment of COVID-19.JID: ANTAGE [m5G; March 16, 2020; 7:11 ] remdesivir was not challenged.
Regular outpatient treatment for TRD such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and ketamine can constitute an important risk for contagion and morbidity in older patients.
Trypsin, an exogeneous activator of plasma membrane fusion, has different cleavage requirements than TMPRSS2.
Like in any other acute and severe infections, there is a risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and for this reason thrombosis prophylaxis in regular doses is pivotal, in principle without need for adjustment of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) doses in case of thrombocytopenia (although in individual cases this should of course always be balanced against bleeding risk) [2].
The first COVID-19 case in the US has improved condition and declined the viral load after treated with remdesivir on illness Day 7, suggesting that remdesivir has the potential to treat COVID-19.
Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory system can activate both NF-kB and STAT3, which in turn can activate the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp), a mechanism for the hyper-activation of NF-kB by STAT3, leading to multiple SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as cell entry receptors, followed by a cytokine-related syndrome, ARDS, which is induced by the hyper-activation of the transcription factor NF-kB, most likely in nonimmune cells including lung epithelial cells.
Up to date, we could not recommend hydroxychloroquine superior to the standard care of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we need to wait for larger randomized trials with target population and sensitive endpoints to valid the value of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.
Auranofin has a well-known toxicity profile and is considered safe for human use.
On the other J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f hand, NLRP3 is likely to be activated following virus entry into the cell [38] [39] [40] 65, 130] .Nevertheless, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome by colchicine has not been firmly demonstrated since in vitro it does not prevent IL-1β secretion induced by typical NLRP3 stimuli (i.e.
The results of our simulations are in line with those of a recent meta analysis of the so far available clinical data, showing that hydroxychloroquine may decrease disease severity but not viral clearance when administered to symptomatic COVID-19 patients [27] .One limitation of the present study resides in the fact that we only modeled the viral dynamics but not the effects of the molecule on immune mediated mechanisms such as the cytokine storm [1] .
Alternatively, fingolimod, an immunomodulating agent being tried for COVID-19, may reduce reperfusion injury and improve outcomes in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke (42).
This dose was subsequently confirmed in the first randomized controlled clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029559) of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, which enroll 62 patients with COVID-19 (31 received HCQ (400 mg/d, 200mg bid), another 31 entered the control group), have found that after 5 days, the clinical recovery time of the hydroxychloroquine group was significantly shortened, and the symptoms of fever and cough were relieved faster (p <0.05).
Inactivation of coronaviruses by disinfectant agents in suspension testsEthanol (78%e95%), iso-propanol (70%e100%), the combination of 45% iso-propanol with 30% n-propanol, glutardialdehyde (0.5e2.5%), formaldehyde (0.7%e1%) and povidone iodine (0.23%e7.5%) readily inactivated coronavirus infectivity by approximately 4 log 10 or more.
The implications fingolimod has on COVID-19 are complex.
The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in human and Chinese horseshoe bats, civet for cell entry, that is also dependent on S protein priming by the serine protease TMPRSS2.
Some of these agents are in phase III trials for COVID-19, including remdesivir, oseltamivir, ASC09F (HIV protease inhibitor), lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, and cobicistat.
Endosomal cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by a low pH and pH-dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins [26].
A coagulation profile to detect the presence of subclinical disseminated intravascular coagulation and the use of low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of thromboembolic disorders should be considered and discussed with physicians and patients.
If used, drug interactions must be screened, and gastrointestinal toxicities, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, and hepatotoxicity, require close monitoring, particularly because elevated aspartate transaminase or ALT may exclude patients with COVID-19 from clinical trials.
Notably, an arginine at the position corresponding to SARS-CoV R667 is conserved for the other five sequences analyzed.
The risk of "rebound" MS disease after fingolimod discontinuation is delayed 2-4 months and is probably mitigated by restarting the drug after COVID-19 recovery, as in our case.

This comparison results that SARS-CoV-2 S has NTD-RBD domain association where a proline residue of ChainA forms CH-п type interaction with the tyrosine residue (28) and hydrophobic interaction with another proline of ChainB (Fig.
Moreover, DM is a pro-inflammatory state characterized by inappropriate and exaggerated cytokine response; this has been depicted in COVID-19 patients wherein serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in patients with DM than those without DM (13) .
A retrospective study of 127 patients with autoimmune myasthenia gravis showed a worsening of the disease after taking treatments such as azithromycin (odds ratio: 1.42), fluoroquinolone (odds ratio: 0.89), and beta-blockers (odds ratio: 2.70).
The patent is owned by the US pharmaceutical company AbbVie, and the licence will allow Israel to import the generic version of Kaletra produced by the Indian company Hetero.
AntimalarialsChloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine have traditionally been used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases; however, the drugs have possible activity against SARS-CoV 1 and SARS-CoV 2 in vitro and in clinical practice, respectively.
Chloroquine phosphate also played a promising role in the management of the Zika virus and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
EMA legt nach: keine Evidenz für erhöhtes RisikoIn der Folge stellte die EMA fest, dass zurzeit keine wissenschaftliche Evidenz für einen Zusammenhang zwischen Ibuprofen und der Verschlechterung von Covid-19 existiert.
This notion has been confirmed in a recent review from Lei Zhang and Yunhui Liu [15] who proposed that besides vitamins A and D also B vitamins, vitamin C, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as selenium, zinc and iron should be considered in the assessment of micronutrients in COVID-19 patients.
36 LPV also blocks a postentry step in the MERS‐CoV replication cycle, conferring this drug a promising potential agent for COVID-19.37 Recent results based on an in silico approach showed that several HIV inhibitors such as LPV, ritonavir (RTV), and saquinavir strongly interact with the active site of COVID-19 proteinase,38 and researchers in China reported that DRV inhibited COVID-19 infection in vitro,39 validating the use of PI against COVID-19.
1,2 We posit that drugs commonly used in the treatment of those comorbidities may actually increase the risk of severe pneumonia, ARDS, and mortality in the setting of COVID-19; the drugs of primary concern include angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) used for blood pressure lowering and statins used for cholesterol lowering.
Thus, to better mimic in vivo conditions, we repeated the above proteolysis assay, using cell-surface-expressed CEACAM1a (instead of recombinant CEACAM1a) and lysosomal extracts (instead of trypsin), and obtained similar results (S6 Fig).
The full extent of GI adverse events of the antiviral treatments for COVID-19, such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir, is not yet clear; however, the existing reports suggest nausea and vomiting and varying degrees of liver test abnormalities as potential side effects.
For example, teicoplanin, oritavancin, dalbavancin, monensin and emetine could be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19.
5 Finally, we know that dupilumab, in addition to treating atopic dermatitis, which in itself can be debilitating, also treats asthma, which could be a complicating factor in COVID-19 infection.
found that lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol, another drug against SARS-CoV, might show benefit in delaying clinical progression of COVID-19 and attenuating viral transmissibility [21] .
Other treatment options with ongoing or planned clinical trials include dosing recombinant human ACE2 to neutralize the virus and prevent lung damage (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04287686) and using the antiviral arbidol, a fusion inhibitor (Kadam and Wilson, 2017; Teissier et al., 2011) .
As shown in Figure 2 , the binding model of nelfinavir in its docking complex turned out to be very similar with that of the original ligand (TG-0205221) 25 author/funder.
10 Using polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrated that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir was incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp, and blocked further incorporation.
In a recent trial with patients on COVID-19 treatment (14), 100% of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin were virologically cured comparing with 57.1% in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone, and 12.5% in the control group.
Both remdesivir and chloroquine are being used for the treatment of other diseases and have a well-defined safety profile.
The widely used antibiotic azithromycin is increasingly recognized as a rare cause of QT o In patients critically ill with COVID-19 infection, frequent caregiver contact may need to be minimized, so optimal electrocardiographic interval and rhythm monitoring may not be possible.• Correction of hypokalemia to levels of >4 mEq/L and hypomagnesemia to levels of >2 mg/dL.• Avoid other QTc prolonging agents 5 whenever feasible.
Ribavirin is not recommended for antiviral treatment in Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for novel Coronavirus disease from Military Medical Team Supporting Wuhan (Trial Version 2), but has been included in the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus-induced Pneumonia (Trial Version 7), which recommend low-dose ribavirin (500 mg each time, 2 to 3 times/day) combined with lopinavir/ritonavir or interferon instead of monotherapy.
2), and the isoleucine by leucine (see fig.

He received intensive drug treatment, including ciclesonide, lopinavir/ritonavir and systemic corticosteroids, as well as respiratory care.
The tandem or dispersed repeats of copy number variants have not been observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
It is known that a diabetic state is associated with higher levels of plasmin(ogen), a protease enzyme that can cleave furin sites in COVID-19 S proteins and allow the virus to have easier infectivity [18] .
Interest has arisen also on the 'old', off-patent antimalarial drug chloroquine and its less toxic hydroxychloroquine analog, both of which are quinine derivatives (cinchoca tree bark, South America).
We show here that hydroxychloroquine is efficient in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in only three to six days, in most patients.
The findings from these uncontrolled data will be informed by the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy for Covid-19.
Data on SARS-CoV-2 removal and/or inactivation by wastewater and water treatment processes, such as activated sludge, membrane filtration, coagulation-sedimentation, and disinfection (chlorine, chloramine, UV, ozone, etc.)
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are two classic drugs 5 , which were originally used to treat malaria.
Notwithstanding this fact, metformin use in patients with severe septic shock has been found to significantly lower in-hospital mortality as compared to non-users (7) .Finally, the discussion on dapagliflozin is also controversial.

Chloroquine is a drug used for an autoimmune disease and malarial infection with potential broad-spectrum antiviral activities 64,65.
In this context, we propose that COVID-19 severity could be treated via the following:1)Interferon therapy to generate adequate immune response2)Use of chloroquine, broad-based antibiotics, and antivirals to limit viral replication and co-infections3)Use of Monalizumab to restore the function of CD8+ T and NK cellsEvaluation of the hypothesisCOVID-19 predominantly seems to affect most patients primarily in the lungs [5], with the primary mode of infection through droplets [6].
Therefore, it is urgent to develop effective drugs against COVID-19.The recent publication of results showing the activity of chloroquine (CQ) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [7] , some experts and researchers also have been recommended the efficacy of this antimalarial drug in patients with COVID-19 [8, 9] .
As the inpatient volume of COVID-19 patients continues to rise, the ability to monitor every patient that is receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on a telemetry unit will not be possible.

Our study further showed that LHM, an elevated 309 baseline neutrophil, DBIL, creatinine, troponin, and the severe symptoms at onset illness 310 were independently associated with the development of critical or death cases in cancer 311 patients with COVID-19, which may provide important implications for the patient cares.
Evidently, Acetazolamide has physiologic effects that delay plasma lactate appearance with no effect on ventilatory threshold [24].
20 However, critically ill cases had more signs of 410 infection and abnormal laboratory findings, including high leukocyte, high procalcitonin, high 411 d-dimer, low albumin, and high creatinine levels.
RCTs are on-going on the efficacy of Remdesivir for COVID-19 infection.
Losartan may also have a protective function against lung fibrosis through other molecular mechanisms such as the downregulation of TGF-β1.
Since d-dimer levels greater than 1 μg/mL at admission were associated with increased odds of death, and since several different pathogeneses may be involved, monitoring of a range of cardiac and coagulation biomarkers that includes d-dimers, troponins T and I, NT-pro-BNP, CRP, Lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen and LDH may allow for a more proactive rather than reactive approach to the management of COVID-19 patients.
Interestingly, one of these studies is employing the IFN alpha via aeresol, probably in order to avoid the systemic adverse events (flu-like syndrome, fatigue, hypothyroidism, creatinine increase) that frequently lead to the drug discontinuation in the hematological patients [85] .
There is currently no large data regarding any possible favorable effects in COVID-19 patients related to possible anti-inflammatory or antiviral effect of azithromycin.
Liver dysfunction, elevated ALTArtificial Intelligence (AI) analysis [36] revealed that a mildly elevated liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is the most predictive clinical biomarker in newly infected patients with SARS-CoV-2 for later development of ARDS.

Potentially relevant to the recent appearance of COVID-19 in China is the fact that there is a belt of selenium deficiency running from northeast to southwest in the country and, indeed, China has populations that have both the lowest and the highest selenium status in the world (1) .
In addition, since darunavir (trade name: Prozekal) is another protease inhibitor used for HIV treatment, a combination of darunavir and ritonavir could also be a potential treatment of COVID-19, especially since darunavir has been approved in China since 2018 for HIV treatment.
Like other human CoVs, this process is generally accomplished by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of S protein proteases such as cathepsins that exposes the fusion domain of the S protein in the endosome 30 or by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) at the plasma membrane 31, 32 .For MERS-CoV, furin-mediated cleavage and fusion also occurs during virus entry 33 , and may be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 34 .
For instance, drugs like lopinavir and ritonavir can inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, thus the drugs dosage should be adjusted when combined with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.
Spending grew 2.6% in 2019, which we expect to ease slightly to 2.2% in 2020.• Elevated protectionism: we expect 2020 to see the weakest growth in total trade since the financial crisis, given ongoing protectionism and slowing global demand.• Moderating business investment: slower global growth, still-high trade tensions, weaker energy activity, a strong dollar, Boeing's woes and the coronavirus fallout will limit business investment growth to just 0.1% in 2020.• Slower housing activity: structural constraints persist in housing, so we see residential investment cooling across 2020 to average growth of 2.7%.• Tame inflation: core PCE inflation hovered below the Fed's 2% target in Q4 and may not rise much in 2020.• Political priorities: tax cuts or major policy initiatives look off the table through to November's elections.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be efficacious in an American patient with COVID-19 64.
5 Currently, the need for external hormones could be reevaluated in healthcare workerssuch as the use of progestins with androgenic activity (for example levonorgestrel or medroxyprogesterone) and the use of androgen replacement therapy -because of the likelihood of increased TMPRSS2 expression in all tissues where it is expressed, including airways and blood vessels.

In a 10 th April letter to stakeholders FDA has similarly shared its concerns on this issue and explicitly advised against any attempts for self-medication with ivermectin for COVID-19 40 .All rights reserved.
In relation to the coronaviruses, emetine activity against four strains of coronavirus had EC50 values ranging from 0.12 to 1.43 μM, with the MERS coronavirus EC50 being 0.34 μM [22].
(2020) study reported that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of COVID-19 infection in vitro experiments.
Leronlimab, a humanised monoclonal antibody (CCR5 antagonist) arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomisation, lopinavir plus ritonavir, ritonavir plus oseltamivir, ASC09F plus oseltamivir, mesenchymal stem cell treatment could also be a choice for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
for a study in Shanghai, China, and they also improved with a combined therapy of lopinavir and ritonavir [20].
In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, Ddimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis.
However, the majority of the COVID-19 patients requiring invasive ventilation in intensive care are likely to satisfy the study eligibility criteria, and the investigators, having conducted several clinical trials of nebulised heparin and having established links within the intensive care community, are in an excellent position to identify and promptly resolve potential threats to the successful conduct of the trial.
Moreover, GS-441524 has been recommended for the treatment of cats with feline infectious peritonitis, which is uncommon but fatal and is caused by a feline coronavirus [14] .The chemical formula of remdesivir, with a molecular mass of 602.6, is C 27 H 35 N 6 O 8 P. Remdesivir can be effectively metabolised to active nucleoside triphosphate in several human cell lines [15] .
11 Chloroquine is a cheap and a safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and, therefore, it is potentially clinically applicable against the 2019-nCoV.Our findings reveal that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro.
Ritonavir had no effect against coronavirus but prolonged bioavailability of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f lopinavir by inhibiting host's cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme [49] .
Remdesivir cured the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in the USA, which prompted Gilead and the Chinese authorities to move the Phase III trial ahead and expand it to a lot more patients who desperately need treatment.
Guidance from China's National Health Commission suggests taking an anti-HIV drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir and inhaling a dose of nebulised interferon α for the antiviral therapy.
1a) , which is consistent with the finding that oseltamivir and zanamivir were (see figure on previous page) Fig.
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20074187 doi: medRxiv preprintAlternate sample-pool protocolWe applied a novel protocol to NAT testing of respiratory swabs for SARS-CoV-2:Respiratory swabs were first incubated in a reference tube containing 4.3 ml of guanidinium thiocyanate buffer solution for 5 minutes with constant agitation.
Based on in vitro evidence and still unpublished clinical experience, the panel recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, at a dose of 500 mg twice per day for 10 days, for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, provided that there were no contraindications to the drug.
Thus, timing of LPV/r administration may be critical to its efficacy .In a multicenter clinical study assessing the compassionate use of remdesivir in severe COVID-19 patients, 53 patients across several countries were treated with remdesivir for 10 days (Grein et al., 2020) .
7A report of a nonrandomized trial of 20 COVID-19 patients in France who received HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin showed that, compared with untreated controls, HCQ reduced nasopharyngeal viral carriage 6 days after the initiation of therapy.
However, an intriguing hypothesis is that adalimumab could inhibit the basic mechanisms of COVID-19 (3), and could be potentially useful in managing/preventing COVID-driven pneumonia.
The data show that SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds to heparin and that upon binding, a significant structural change is induced.
For example, with respect to the original Wuhan isolate [2] , phenylalanine (F) is replaced by cysteine (C) as residue 797 in a Swedish isolate, and alanine (A) is replaced by valine (V) as residue 990 in an Indian isolate.
Hydroxychloroquine was approved by FDA for emergency use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are not eligible for clinical trials on April 7, 2020 based on limited clinical data, but concerns have been raised about toxicity and risk of sudden death 29 .Our findings from the EHR analysis of COVID-19 progression can aid in a human pathophysiology enabled summary of the experimental therapies being investigated for COVID-19 ( Figure 2 , Table S2 ).
Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a broad-based antiviral drug originally designed to target Ebola and was developed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f by Gilead Sciences.
For these reasons, hydroxychloroquine should be preferentially administered within the framework of investigational studies.
The antiviral drug remdesivir (RDV) can inhibit the growth of COVID-19 and found to be efficacious in the clinic in combination.
The region around arginine 667 (R667) of SARS-CoV S, the S1/S2 cleavage site, aligned well with SARS-CoV-2 and the bat SARSrelated sequences [56] .
13, 16, 17 In a lethal murine model of MERS, remdesivir was superior to a regimen of combined interferon beta and lopinavir-ritonavir.
Arbidol was also shown to have direct antiviral effects by inhibiting the replication of SARS virus in vitro [ 1 3 ] .Despite the above preliminary evidence, the actual clinical efficacy of LPV/r or arbidol against SARS-CoV-2 are unknown.
The g. 29039A>U is a nonsense mutation occurring in the linker region of the Nucleocapsid protein, close to the 3 end of the viral genome and causing the substitution of Lysine 256 with a stop codon (p. Lys256 * ; see Fig.
Reducing the rate of undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infections and their contagiousness is crucial to sustain COVID-19 containment measures [2] .
Antiviral drugs and systemic corticosteroid treatment commonly used in clinical practice previously, including neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, etc), ganciclovir, acyclovir, and ribavirin, as well as methylprednisolone [46, 75] for influenza virus, are invalid for COVID-19 and not recommended.
Administering 600mg base equivalent of chloroquine phosphate twice daily for ten days as in the CloroCovid-19 trial is predicted to result in absolute mean fatality ratios ranging between 0.06% (90kg, 95% credible interval (C.I.
Another ongoing phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in 452 hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease [13] .
The screening results (Table 1 and supporting excel file PLpro.xlsx) showed that a series of anti-virus drugs (ribavirin, valganciclovir and thymidine), anti-bacterial drugs (chloramphenicol, cefamandole and tigecycline), muscle relaxant drug (chlorphenesin carbamate), anti-tussive drug (levodropropizine) may have high binding affinity to PLpro.
The docking results of arbidol with the possible drug targets of the new coronavirus showed that it may interact with Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp14, Nsp15, E-channel, or Spike with the mfScores of À136.087, À118.253, À118.253, À117.879, and À145.125, respectively.
On the basis of hydroxychloroquine's superior antiviral and prophylactic activity, as well as its more tolerable safety profile in comparison to chloroquine, we believe that hydroxychloroquine may be a promising drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [24] .
Samples and collection tubesSixty nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from healthy volunteers using Rayon swab and placed into tubes containing 4.3 mL of guanidine hydrochloride (40%), which virtually inactivates the virus and preserves all RNA in the specimen.
29 Whether tocilizumab can restore T cell counts in COVID-19 patients by suppressing IL-6 signaling remains uninvestigated.
The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM 1X, GIBCO) and supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), antibiotics (0.1 units penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, GIBCO) at 37°C in humidified 5% CO 2 incubator.
As we have previously demonstrated that several glycopeptide antibiotics, including teicoplanin and dalbavancin, exhibited specific inhibitory effects on cathepsin L, we therefore hypothesized that teicoplanin and its homologs could also inhibit the entry of 2019-nCoV.The data illustrated that the dalbavancin also repressed the entry of 2019-nCoV in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3C ).
In this condition, the EC50 of Teriflunomide could reach 6μM with SI>33, indicating that Teriflunomide with effective EC50 and SI values have all the potentials to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 disease as an 'old drug in new use' option.
If values are low, use of testosterone may be considered to reduce the associated pulmonary syndrome, thus preventing progression to severe COVID-19 disease where pro-inflammatory cytokines play a major role.
A disease severity grading system may provide an objective tool to assess the most appropriate timing to initiate tocilizumab treatment.
74 In addition, the inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A could block the replication of coronavirus of all genera, including SARS‐CoV as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus.
Apparently, Tocilizumab provided a new therapeutic strategy for severe and critical cases, although the evidence strength needs to be enhanced, the results of further controlled trial studies will clarify the true clinical impact of this IL-6-blocking treatment on COVID-19 infection.
SARS-CoV-2 surface S1 Receptor Binding Domain binds heparin Introduction Heparin, the second most widely used drug by weight globally, is formulated as a polydisperse, heterogenous natural product.
The prediction was externally validated by a recent drug screening against SARS-CoV-2 21 Disease signaturesWe obtained a total of 430 samples for "SARS" or "MERS" related data from ArrayExpress, Gene Reversal correlationThe computation of RGES and the summarization RGES were detailed elsewhere and recently implemented as a standalone R package 31 Clustering of virus predictionsWe Ritonavir correlation analysisWe The negative correlation means a reversal relation.
Compared with COVID-19 patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia had higher levels of interleukin-6, B lymphocyte proportion, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and very low count (<190/µL) of CD8 + T cells (Table 2) .The copyright holder for this preprint .
Larger controlled clinical studies are needed to evaluate the role of LPV/r (potentially in combination with ribavirin) in COVID-19 (Table) .
What happens at the cellular level is a high production of GM-CSF and others inflammatory cytokines by CD4+ T cells with further activation of CD14+ CD16+ monocytes to produce interleukin-6 (IL-6).
Unequivocally, many elective non-urgent surgeries will become urgent at some point in time, depending on how long the COVID-19 outbreak will prevail.
Given the homology of SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses, it is likely that antigens used as targets in poorly designed assays will cross react.
Among the most promising candidates are remdesivir and chloroquine.
[15] Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are 4-aminoquinolines and are in the National List of Essential Medicines of India.
36 Broad-spectrum antivirals, such as remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta, have shown promise against MERS-CoV in animal models, and their activity against the present 2019-nCoV is being evaluated.
Ohio 13 "Unless otherwise approved by the board's executive director, no prescription for chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine may be dispensed by a pharmacist or sold at retail by a licensed terminal distributor of dangerous drugs unless all the following apply:(1) The prescription bears a written diagnosis code from the prescriber; and (2) If written for a COVID-19 diagnosis, the diagnosis has been confirmed by a positive test result, which is documented on the prescription and both of the following apply:(a) The prescription is limited to no more than a fourteen-day supply; and (b) No refills may be permitted unless a new prescription is furnished."
The EC50 (half maximal effective concentrations) was significantly higher than for chloroquine and remdesivir, so it appears less potent in vitro compared to these agents [51] .
Because he lacked respiratory symptoms, the infectious disease service deemed him not to be a candidate for clinical trial of remdesivir.
Several other research groups have also found a relationship between COVID-19 and liver injury, in particular, abnormal levels of ALT and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (for review see [5] ).
There are in vitro studies that show both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, although hydroxychloroquine appears to be more potent [45].
Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than that of chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose [13] and has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions [14] .
1 ) for their ability to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV RdRps: Ganciclovir 5'-triphosphate, Carbovir 5'-triphosphate, Cidofovir diphosphate, Stavudine 5'triphosphate, Entecavir 5'-triphosphate, 2'-O-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate, 3'-O-methyluridine-5'triphosphate, 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate, desthiobiotin-16-aminoallyl-2'-uridine-5'triphosphate, biotin-16-aminoallyl-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate, and 2'-aminouridine-5'-triphosphate.
Finally, antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro has been recently reported for ivermectin, but clinical data is still lacking [32] .
More recently, the mechanisms of antiviral effect, the risk-benefit ratio, and the thresholds of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have been reviewed, and attention has been drawn to the need for high-quality evaluation protocols of the potential beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine as a post-exposure drug for people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e.
PlasmidThe SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain expression plasmid (Figures 1b) were a kind gift from Dr. McLellan at the University of Texas, Austin, TX, and was previously detailed 21 .Transformation of E. Coli (TOP10 competent cells, Invitrogen) cultured under ampicillin selection enabled plasmid production, which was purified using NucleoBond Xtra Maxi EF (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's directions.
Finally, efficient deactivation of different coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 was not evaluated) has been reported with disinfectants such as 62% to 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute; this efficacy is highly likely to apply to SARS-CoV-2 [57].
Lymphocyte count, CRP, D-dimer, BNP, albumin, and potassium were abnormal throughout most of the course of the severe COVID-19 patients ( Figure 1 ).
The multiple molecular mechanisms by which chloroquine can achieve such results remain to be further explored.
52 53 Air pollution is a complex mixture of small particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitric 54 dioxide (NO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), Ozone (O 3 ) and volatile organic compounds 55 (VOCs) derived from vehicular traffic, industrial emissions, and indoor pollutants.
S312 exhibited equivalent antiviral activities to Oseltamivir in influenza-A-virusinfected animals.
The S proteins of SARS-CoV can use the endosomal cysteine proteases CatB/L for S protein priming in TMPRSS2 À cells (Simmons et al., 2005) .
Gautret et al, 23 in a non randomized clinical trial in 36 COVID-19 patients, reported viral load reduction by HCQ and its reinforcement by azithromycin.
The patient was started on hydroxychloroquine.
Similarly, the prevalence of death, ARDS, headache, increased leukocyte count, and increased lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in studies in which the proportion of older patients was larger (all p<0.05), and the prevalence of diarrhea, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in studies in which the proportion of patients with any coexisting medical condition was larger (all p<0.05).
A recent report by Matsuyama et al.corroborated our finding of ciclesonide as a potential antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 12 .
The inclusion criteria were hospitalized COVID-19 patients with SpO2 ≤ 94% on ambient air or supplemental oxygen, creatinine clearance > 30 ml/min, serum aminotransferases less than 5 times the upper limit of normal and not on other investigational drugs for COVID-19.
Moreover, although the cell surface receptor ACE2 and the serine protease TMPRSS2 have been demonstrated to serve as entry determinants for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 2,7-9 , an accumulating body of evidence showing dissimilar human-to-human transmission dynamics and clinical courses between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strongly suggest the presence of different virus-host dynamics during viral infection in the human respiratory epithelium [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .The human conductive respiratory tract is lined by a pseudostratified, ciliated, columnar epithelium with mucin-producing goblet cells and represents an important barrier to constrain invading pathogens.
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as this was described as an optimal target for neutralizing antibodies 43 ; 2) the viral S-glycoprotein region binding the glycosylated portion of ACE2, an interaction inhibited by pretreatment with chloroquine 44, 45 , a drug recently shown to effectively hamper SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in patients 46, 47 .In order to translate these approaches into vaccine design: 1) We performed a thorough analysis for molecular complexes of the viral S-glycoprotein with the entry receptor ACE2.
Chloroquine was used as a positive control 37, 38 .Remarkably, at concentration 100 nmol/L, DIP suppressed more than 50% of SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig.
Two drugs, Remdesvir and Chloroquine, developed for treating Ebola virus and Malaria, respectively, have been approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19 as Emergency Use Authorization, although no formal clinical trial has been finished [5, 6] .
J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f E xp e r i e n c e i n c r i t i c a l l y i l l p a t i e n t s Unfortunately, despite the beneficial effects achieved with ozone therapy, its application in critical units is very limited.
In addition, albumin, urea and red cell distribution width (RDW) were also mentioned as indicative of severe COVID-19 infection 26 .
If tocilizumab does prove to be effective, it will come at a substantial cost, both economic, as it is very expensive, and therapeutic, as it can only be delivered by intravenous infusion (7) .Is there a simpler, widely available alternative to tocilizumab that would be readily accessible and not require parenteral administration?
COVID-19 has once again brought remdesivir to the stage of clinical trials.
Of which five studies on hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol, mesenchymal stem cells, traditional Chinese medicine and glucocorticoid therapy usage have commenced recruitment.
In summary, combination of mercaptopurine and melatonin may offer a potential combination therapy for 2019-nCoV by synergistically targeting papain-like protease, ACE2, c-Jun signaling, and anti-inflammatory pathways ( Figure 6D) .
The NIAID trial is a multinational placebo-controlled trail of 440 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, initially comparing remdesivir with placebo.
[8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In these studies, elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were reported, ranging from 14% to 53%.
There is evidence that in patients with confirmed ARDS, not infected with COVID-19, a benefit from dexamethasone is provided when used at a low dosage and for a limited period (10 days) in reducing the consequences of mortality [28] thus supporting the assistance of such therapy on elective indication.
Statin therapy has proven effective in improving hyperlipidaemia in patients with human immunodeficiency virus receiving protease inhibitor treatment10 and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving tocilizumab (Figure 1).2 Most statins undergo hepatic metabolism through CYP3A4, and concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors currently used in COVID-19, such as ritonavir and cobicistat, could increase the risk of muscle and liver toxicity; therefore, starting with a lower dose of statin and monitoring creatine kinase and transaminases would be advisable in these cases.
Evidence suggests that such preoccupations may degenerate in heightened anxiety and stress responses with downstream effects on health, on turn resulting in misplaced health-protective and help-seeking behaviors (Garfin et al., 2020) .Here, we report a case of symptom exacerbation of a Severe and Persistent Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD), triggered by the fear of having COVID-19 ( Figure 1 ).
11 The follow-up study by the same group in a cohort of 1061 COVID-19 patients demonstrated that a hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination when given during the early phase of the disease, prevents aggravation of the disease and viral persistence.
Apart from tocilizumab, which counteracts inflammatory phenomena deriving mainly from activities of IL-6, other drugs, mainly represented by antivirals (the combined treatment lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, umifenovir), are currently under evaluation for the treatment of SARS-Cov-2 [3] .
Most rheumatologists perceived the need to change treatment of RDs during the COVID-19 pandemic; reduce immunosuppression and defer the usage of rituximab and bDMARDs.
Randomized, controlled, open-label trials on confirmed positive COVID-19 adult patients with ARDS have been performed using a 14-day course of lopinavir and ritonavir 400-100mg twice daily.
Patients were excluded if they meet any of following criteria: (1) allergic to Favipiravir or Arbidol; (2) with elevated ALT/AST (>6x upper limit of normal range) or with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis at grade Child-Pugh C); (3) severe/critical patients whose expected survival time were <48 hours; (4) female in pregnancy; (5) HIV infection; or (6) considered unsuitable by researchers for the patient's best interest.
The different classes of antivirals under evaluation include 3CL protein inhibitors (Ribavirin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir), RNA synthesis inhibitors (Remdesivir, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/TDF and 3TC), neuraminidase inhibitors (Tamiflu and Peramivir ) [4] and other small molecule drugs which target the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to interact with host cells (ACE2 inhibitors) [3, 5] .
Furthermore, chloroquine may be more effective as a prophylactic treatment owing to its activity during the early stages of a viral cycle, during which it establishes residence in the host through replication of SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation period in patients in the initial stage of the disease, which is a mild condition [7] .Recently, Wang et al.
Although this study has significant implications repurposing and knowing the drug target and in understanding the mechanism of viral inhibition, the efficacy and safety of Arbidol against SARS-CoV-2 still requires clinical investigation.
The ideal higher dose of ivermectin has not been established.
Furthermore, there is an association of elevated plasmin levels with the strong induction of D-dimer as a product of hyper-fibrinolysis, which is an additional critical parameter of severe COVID-19 progression [42, 43, 61] .Once the virus enters the cell, the viral RNA is released and the host-cell's cellular programs are utilized for viral replication.
These inappropriate statements led to a warning by the US FDA, that ivermectin in veterinary products should not be used for human therapy, https: //www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/fda-letterstakeholders-do-not-use-ivermectin-intended-animals-treatment-covid-19-humans The FDA message also explains that in vitro studies such as the report in AVR are "commonly used in the early stages of drug development.
In the current case, PE followed by IVIG was initiated when signs of the cytokine storm appeared (that is, decreased oxygenation index, progressively declined lymphocyte count, serum enzymes and creatine levels began to increase, shock, high levels of CRP).
Captopril was withdrawn in the emergency room prior to confirmation of the diagnosis.
Among the above clinically advancing several random drugs trails against SARS-CoV-2, Arbidol (Umifenovir) (Fig.
Kidney Transplant Recipients with Covid-19: Admission Vitals and Laboratory Values in Hospitalized Patients1 Acute kidney injury as defined by absolute creatinine increase of ≥ 0.5mg/dL or 30% increase from baseline creatinine 2 Data based on the following numbers of patients, creatinine, white blood cell and lymphocyte count n=37, procalcitonin n=35, albumin n=34, C-reactive protein n=29, ferritin n=28, d-dimer n=26, Interleukin-6 n=9.
In another work, it was demonstrated that when ambient ozone concentration level increased the transmission ability of influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and Influenza B) decreased substantially (Ali et al., 2018) .
A recent case report showed that treatment with remdesivir improved the clinical condition of the first patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the United States 2 , and a phase III clinical trial of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 was launched in Wuhan on February 4, 2020.
Therefore, it is urgent to test the effect of Chloroquine on infected patients to see its therapeutic benefit on COVID-19 in clinic.
36 The recent integrative antiviral drug repurposing analysis implicated another ARB—irbesartan—as a potential repurposable medication for COVID-19.10 In fact, the known effect of ARBs on potassium metabolism may be seen as clinically advantageous in patients infected by COVID-19 given that hypokalaemia was reported as a fairly common manifestation of COVID-19 (possibly through increased kaliuresis rather than gastrointestinal loss).38 Hypokalaemia in COVID-19 patients is difficult to manage, correlates with the severity of the disease, and has been suggested to be driven by activation of the RAAS.38 ACEIs or ARBs might offer some protection in this setting.
The inhalation of buformin or phenformin for coronavirus may be an effective novel treatment that would limit the risk of systemic side-effects associated with biguanides due to a low inhaled dose.
Nineteen patients discharged on average 13.5 ± 3.1 days hospitalization time after the treatment with tocilizumab.
8 A multicentre, randomised con trolled trial of tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blockade, licensed for cytokine release syndrome), has been approved in patients withCOVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppressionAs of March 12, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been con firmed in 125 048 people worldwide, carrying a mortality of approximately 3·7%, 1 compared with a mortality rate of less than 1% from influenza.
Hydroxychloroquine, an analogue of chloroquine, has been proved to have similar if not better in-vitro efficacy on SARS-Cov-2.
Salient features of the patient's initial clinical laboratory trend include lymphocytopenia, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia and elevated creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, Ddimer and ferritin levels.
Apart from classical adjuvants, the use of an "adjuvant" drug such as chloroquine, is of particular interest for SARS-CoV-2.
Finally, they found that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination have cured the COVID-19 patients but the drawback of this study is used a very small size of survey.
Remdesivir shows EC90 of 1.76 μM against COVID-19 in vitro [30].
The pharmacology of intravenous remdesivir is unknown and it might not be widely available, whereas lopinavir–ritonavir is safe during pregnancy but is only available in tablets.
Several RCTs are also ongoing to evaluate J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof these drugs in the context of COVID-19 (n=32 registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov; n=16with the Chinese clinical trial registry).In conclusion, it is noteworthy that several national guidelines already include chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine whereas the IDSA recommends reserving its use (in combination with azithromycin or not) for clinical trials.
Furthermore, harmful drug interactions of antivirals with other drugs (such as hydroxychloroquine) cannot be excluded a priori, since there are currently no large clinical data about the use of these combinations.
One medication that has shown promise is hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
Based on these results, Cidofovir and the oral prodrug Brincidofovir are thus potential leads for COVID-19 and SARS.
DiscussionThe research letter, written by a group of Chinese researchers, studied the effect of chloroquine in vitro, using Vero E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05.
Importantly, naproxen has the advantage of being a generic drug, readily available and often used for other indications than COVID-19 by fragile populations.
Inhibitors of TMPRSS2 serine proteaseResults from previous studies reveal that diverse viruses, including Ebola virus, SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and influenza virus employ host cell proteases for activation of their envelope glycoproteins [16] [17] [18] .
One RCT is currently underway to evaluate the role of naproxen in those critically ill with COVID-19 [68] .Should ACE and ARB's for hypertension be stopped in patients infected with COVID19?Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS CoV-2 on human cells.
on the potential benefits of combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [5] , an ECG was performed before initiating treatment and at inpatients with more severe symptoms of COVID-19, including some in critical care, hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin prolonged the QTc to > 500 ms in 11% [6] .
Of note, in type 2 diabetic mice, the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone normalized hyperglycemia, attenuated renal injury and decreased urinary ACE2 excretion and renal ADAM17 protein expression, but, unlike insulin, did not affect renal ACE2 expression (33) .
Because of the absence of fever and respiratory symptoms, it was decided to keep her in isolation at home, but the planned fourth cycle of paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy was postponed.
Moreover, compounds 25 and 22 proved to be the most potent and safe antivirals among these series, being able to inhibit RSV replication with the same degree of potency of ribavirin, w is the only drug available to treat RSV infections, but its limited efficacy and low margin of safety restrict its use to children at high risk [50].
As we were preparing this report we have determined and deposited to PDB higher resolution 1.90 Å structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 in complex with citrate (PDB id 6W01).
Patient received supportive care with nasal 100 % O 2 along with oral administration of Oseltamivir capsule 75 mg bid and Hydroxychloroquine tablet 200 mg bid.
Le bénéfice thérapeutique potentiel de la chlorpromazine contre le COVID-19 repose à la fois sur l'observation dans plusieurs unités psychiatriques d'une faible propagation des formes symptomatiques de COVID-19 parmi les patients et sur des arguments virologiques.
57 Unfractionated heparin binds SARS-CoV-2 and prevents cell invasion by CoronavirusA recent study demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain attaches to unfractionated heparin and undergoes conformational change as a result.
Some immunomodulatory therapies have indeed proven beneficial in patients with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19; for example, tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, was effective as a supportive therapy in selected COVID-19 patients.
Legend: Number of hospital admissions by age group.
Comparison of the RBD amino acid sequence (residues 330-583) with an extensive library of sequences from known heparin binding proteins (Tables 2 and 3 ) based on the Levenstein Distance, which provides a measure of the degree of similarity between the sequences, suggests that wider areas of the RBD surface may be available (Figure 7) for binding to host cell surface glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides.
In addition to these drugs, Remdesivir along with Favipiravir which has already been suggested for the treatment of COVID-19, was also found to be effective as the inhibitor of RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 [14] .

The GAG heparin has previously been shown to inhibit SARS-associated coronavirus cell invasion 2,3,13 and this, in concert with the LMWH data presented within this study, supports the use of GAG-derived pharmaceuticals as therapeutic agents against SARS-associated coronavirus.
We previously reported that CoV resistance to another broad-spectrum nucleoside analog, remdesivir (RDV), was mediated by RdRp residues F480L and V557L in a model CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and in SARS-CoV, resulting in a fivefold shift in IC50 (Fig.
In addition, in vitro or in vivo studies have suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [13, 14] , remdesivir [15] and arbidol [16] are effective in inhibiting viral replication in SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV), MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections [17] .
It is possible that chloroquine interferes with ACE2 receptor glycosylation, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.
After the third day on hydroxychloroquine, his fever has subsided and the patient started feeling better.
Known therapies to mitigate TdP, such as maintaining potassium and magnesium levels and heart rates .70 beats per minute, are incorporated into our flow chart.
1 proposing the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Since SARS-CoV-2 was found a few days ago to utilise the same cell surface receptor ACE2 (expressed in lung, heart, kidney and intestine) as SARS-CoV-1 [85 , 86] ( Table 1 ) , it may be hypothesised that chloroquine also interferes with ACE2 receptor glycosylation thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.
In contrast, a randomized study of hydroxychloroquine published in Chinese showed no impact of hydroxychloroquine with a dose of 400mg hydroxychloroquine daily for 5 days on increasing virus negative conversion rate and alleviation of clinical symptoms in 30 patients with COVID-19.
Notably, two compounds remdesivir (EC50 = 0.77 μM; CC50 > 100 μM; SI > 129.87) and chloroquine (EC50 = 1.13 μM; CC50 > 100 μM, SI > 88.50) potently blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high SI (Fig.
RemdesivirRemdesivir (GS-5734), (CAS number: 1809249-37-3), is a novel small-molecule adenine nucleotide analogue antiviral drug that has shown efficacy against Ebola virus in rhesus monkeys.
A multicentre randomised controlled trial to test a monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab, Roche) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated IL-6 has been conducted in China with promising results (ChiCTR2000029765).
While aggressive medical management should be individualized, it is worth considering PPI infusions over intermittent IV administration, liberalized octreotide infusions for patients with suspected or known liver disease, scheduled antiemetics, platelets and/or clotting factors to correct iatrogenic or acquired coagulopathies, and reversal agents if appropriate.
For example, chloroquine, an anti-plasmodium drug, has been found partially effective in clinic.
Combination therapy with 2019-nCoV specific monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir can be considered as the ideal therapeutic option for 2019-nCoV (Cohen 2020).
Suppression of ACE2 expression by inflammatory cytokines accompanied by the decrease of androgens and estrogens of the elderly, may establish a negative correlation between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 mortality 19 .Measuring testosterone levels may be recommended at the time of an identified COVID-19 positive patient.
As of Mar 8, 2020, 73 clinical trials have been registered in Clinicaltrial.gov, in which nearly one fifth reagents are small molecular compounds, such as remdesivir and oseltamivir, and four are antibody drugs like PD-1 blocking antibody, bevacizumab, eculizumab, and meplazumab.
Se debe indicar la doble antiagregación con AAS y un inhibidor del P2Y12, priorizando prasugrel y ticagrelor sobre clopidogrel.
Remdesivir was also suggested to give positive results when used against SARS-CoV-2, and a clinical trial sponsored by the NIH began in February 2020.
For instance, entry of the MERS-CoV-related bat coronavirus HKU4 into human cells required addition of exogenous trypsin, indicating that S proteolytic activation of this bat virus did not occur in human cells (despite its ability to recognize human DPP4) Yang et al., 2014) .
As a major inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome [31] , colchicine could be utilized for the treatment of COVID-19.
Nitazoxanide (Fig.
Our work also shows that because of the contagious nature of the COVID19 and the crucial role of the domestic transportation networks, even a small infected population is sufficient to sustain and spread the pandemic.
Administering nebulised heparin will not significantly increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for clinicians who follow the standard recommended personal protection precautions for the care of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases.
For instance, significant QT prolongations may result from combinations of hydroxychloroquine and haloperidol.
Patients were excluded if they had a known allergy to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine or had another known contraindication to treatment with the study drug, including retinopathy, G6PD deficiency and QT prolongation.
Moreover, the ITC profiles in combination with their chemical structures suggest that baicalin and baicalein act as noncovalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with a high ligand binding efficiency.
2B) .Functions with increased relative abundance are linked to energy metabolism (methane, nitrogen, sulfur), metabolism of cofactors and vitamins (B6, folate, lipoic acid) and purine -related to one-carbon metabolism, nucleotide metabolism (purine, pyrimidine), and drug metabolism.
In contrast, oseltamivir, zanamivir (drugs used for preventing influenza virus infection) and baricitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor, which was recommended in [18] to treat showed no inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 at the concentration of 3 µM or 3.2 µM.Based on the above pilot experimental results, we then chose CVL218 for subsequent experimental studies.
35 Unpublished data based on off-label use of tocilizumab along with lopinavir and methylprednisolone in 21 severely ill COVID-19 patients suggested that the addition of tocilizumab not only quickly reduced their clinical symptoms (fever, oxygen requirement) and inflammation, but also normalized peripheral blood T cell counts in the majority of patients.
