stability, bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles.', 'Crucially, heparin and its derivatives, some of which lacking significant anticoagulant activity 1 , are an under-exploited antiviral drug

herpes 5 , influenza 6 and HIV 7, 8 .Traditional drug development processes are slow and ineffective against emerging public health threats such as the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak which makes the repurposing of existing drugs a timely and attractive alternative.', 'Heparin, a well-tolerated anticoagulant pharmaceutical, has been used safely in medicine for over 80 years and alongside its anticoagulant activities, its ability to prevent viral infection, including coronaviridae, has been described 1 .', 'Here, we describe preliminary tests for the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to bind heparin, an important prerequisite for the underpinning research related to the development of SARS-CoV-2 heparin-based therapeutic.', 'Spectra of heparin (porcine mucosal heparin), its

(Figure 7) were conducted and indicated that there are several potential heparin binding sites and, importantly, these patches of basic amino acids are exposed on the protein surface.', 'Analysis of the RBD sequence for potential heparin binding sites employing a metric based on the Levenshtein distance (a measure of the similarity between two sequences) found that the basic amino acids sequences

'Conversely, this region also interacts with the orthodox receptor of the spike protein ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD 436-529), suggesting that heparin and its derivatives interfere with the interactions between the virus, via these residues.', 'Here, the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to bind pharmaceutical heparin, studied using spectroscopic techniques, showed that SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds to heparin and that, upon binding, a significant conformational change is induced.', 'Moreover, moieties of basic amino acid residues that are common constituents of heparin binding domains, and accessible to solvent on the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD surface, form a continuous patch ((R454, R457, K458, K462, R466, R346, R355, K356 and R346 in Figure  7) , suitable for heparin binding.', 'Comparison of the RBD amino acid sequence (residues 330-583) with an extensive library of sequences from known heparin binding proteins (Tables 2 and 3 ) based on the Levenstein Distance, which provides a measure of the degree of similarity between the sequences, suggests that wider areas of the RBD surface may be available (Figure 7) for binding to host cell surface glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides.',

of coronavirus budding is determined by the localisation of its membrane M proteins that accumulate in the Golgi complex beyond the site of virion budding [67] , suggesting a possible action of chloroquine on SARS-CoV-2 at this step of the replication cycle.', 'It was recently reported that the C-terminal domain of the MERS-CoV M protein contains a trans-Golgi network localisation signal [68] .Beside affecting the virus maturation process, pH modulation by chloroquine can impair the proper maturation of viral protein [32] and the recognition of viral antigen by dendritic cells, which occurs through a Toll-like receptor-dependent pathway that requires endosomal acidification [69] .', 'Chloroquine is a well-known immunomodulatory agent capable of mediating an anti-inflammatory response [11] .', 'Recent publications support the hypothesis that chloroquine can improve the clinical outcome of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.', 'The multiple molecular mechanisms by which chloroquine can achieve such results remain to be further explored.', 'Since SARS-CoV-2 was found a few days ago to utilise the same cell surface receptor ACE2 (expressed in lung, heart, kidney and intestine) as SARS-CoV-1 [85 , 86] ( Table 1 ) , it may be hypothesised that chloroquine also interferes with ACE2 receptor glycosylation thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.', 'Although the binding of SARS-CoV to sialic acids has not been reported so far (it is expected that Betacoronavirus adaptation to humans involves progressive loss of hemagglutinin-esterase lectin activity), if SARS-CoV-2 like other coronaviruses targets sialic acids on some cell subtypes, this interaction will be affected by chloroquine treatment [87 , 88] .', 'Today, preliminary data indicate that chloroquine interferes with SARS-CoV-2 attempts to acidify the lysosomes and presumably inhibits cathepsins, which require a low pH for optimal cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [89] , a prerequisite to the formation of the autophagosome [49] .', 'Obviously, it can be hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 molecular crosstalk with its target cell can be altered by chloroquine through inhibition of kinases such as MAPK.', 'Chloroquine could also interfere with proteolytic processing of the M protein and alter virion assembly and budding ( Fig.', 'It is possible that chloroquine interferes with ACE2 receptor glycosylation, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.', 'Chloroquine could also possibly limit the biosynthesis of sialic acids that may be required for cell surface binding of SARS-CoV-2.', 'If binding of some viral particles is achieved, chloroquine may modulate the acidification of endosomes thereby inhibiting formation of the autophagosome.']"
